A longitudinal study tracked 1200 individuals from the year 2000 for 30 years, or until death, whichever came first. At the start of the study in 2000, 600 individuals were infected with Disease A and 600 with Disease B. For each disease, 300 individuals were initially in Stage 1 of the disease and 300 were in Stage 2.
The disease progresses from Stage 1 to Stage 2 to Stage 3, after which death may occur. Individuals cannot recover or skip stages. Every 10 years (at checkpoints 2010, 2020, 2030), surviving individuals who are in Stage 1 or Stage 2 progress to the next stage. Individuals in Stage 3 may either die in the subsequent decade or survive and remain in Stage 3 at the next checkpoint.
A ""Co-morbidity Factor (CF)"" is recorded for individuals upon reaching Stage 3. If an individual's CF is greater than 1.5, they are considered ""High CF"".
The table below shows the number of individuals alive at each checkpoint, categorized by disease and stage. Some values are missing.

A longitudinal study tracked 1200 individuals from the year 2000 for 30 years, or until death, whichever came first. At the start of the study in 2000, 600 individuals were infected with Disease A and 600 with Disease B. For each disease, 300 individuals were initially in Stage 1 of the disease and 300 were in Stage 2.
The disease progresses from Stage 1 to Stage 2 to Stage 3, after which death may occur. Individuals cannot recover or skip stages. Every 10 years (at checkpoints 2010, 2020, 2030), surviving individuals who are in Stage 1 or Stage 2 progress to the next stage. Individuals in Stage 3 may either die in the subsequent decade or survive and remain in Stage 3 at the next checkpoint.
A ""Co-morbidity Factor (CF)"" is recorded for individuals upon reaching Stage 3. If an individual's CF is greater than 1.5, they are considered ""High CF"".
The table below shows the number of individuals alive at each checkpoint, categorized by disease and stage. Some values are missing.

2000-2010 Decade:
•	Disease A: Clue 1 states deaths from Disease A (2000-2010) = 30.
From the table, for Disease A in 2010: Stage 2 (Alive) = 280, Stage 3 (Alive) = 290.

•	Disease B: From the table, for Disease B in 2010: Stage 3 (Alive) = 285.
Clue 2 states for Disease B, Stage 2 (Alive) in 2010 = 270.
Individuals from Stage 1 (2000) who progressed to Stage 2 (2010) and survived = 270. Deaths from this S1 cohort = 300 - 270 = 30.

Clue 5 states Total Alive A (2020) = 450. From the table, Stage 3 (Alive) for A in 2020 = 450. This is consistent as all survivors must be in Stage 3 by 2020 if they started in S1 or S2 in 2000.
Verification: Total Alive A (2010) = 570. Deaths A (2010-2020) = 570 - 450 = 120. This matches.
•	Disease B: From the table, Stage 3 (Alive) for B in 2020 = 410, so Total Alive B (2020) = 410.
Deaths B (2010-2020) = Total Alive B (2010) - Total Alive B (2020) = 555 - 410 = 145.

Solution:
We count the projects that received exactly 2 million in funding from the final table:
Nova: Q1(E,2), Q4(E,2) – (2 projects)
Solara: Q2(T,2), Q3(E,2) – (2 projects)
Terra: None
Luna: Q3(I,2) – (1 project)
Total projects with funding of 2 million = 2 + 2 + 0 + 1 = 5 projects."

Solution:
Beta's capital path: 20 (R0), 19 (R1), 21 (R2), 20 (R3), 20 (R4), 18 (R5), 20 (R6).
Maximum capital for Beta = $21M (at end of R2).
Minimum capital for Beta = $18M (at end of R5).
Volatility Index (VI) for Beta = Max - Min = 21 - 18 = $3M."

Four investment funds – Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta – participated in a series of 6 investment rounds. In each round, the four funds formed two distinct pairs, with each fund belonging to exactly one pair. A pair of funds could not be the same in two consecutive rounds.
In each round, if a pair of funds decided to make an investment, they chose between a High Impact (IH) investment resulting in a $2M change or a Low Impact (IL) investment resulting in a $1M change. If an investment was made, one fund in the pair gained the chosen amount from the other fund in the pair. If they decided not to invest (NI), no money was exchanged.
Each fund started with $20M before Round 1. A fund's Volatility Index (VI) is defined as the difference between its maximum and minimum capital amounts observed at the end of any of the 6 rounds (including the end of Round 0, which is the initial capital).

Solution:
Occurrences of $20M end-of-round capital for each fund:
Alpha: R0, R2, R3, R5 (4 times).
Beta: R0, R3, R4, R6 (4 times).
Gamma: R0, R3 (2 times).
Delta: R0, R2, R3, R4 (4 times).
Alpha, Beta, and Delta each had their capital at $20M for 4 rounds, which is the most number of times. Since Delta is one of these funds and is provided as an option, it is a correct answer."

Solution:
The question asks: ""In which round was Gamma paired with Beta, resulting in Gamma winning an IL investment?""
From our derived path and pairings:
Round 1: Pairs (A,G), (B,D). Gamma was not paired with Beta, or Gamma lost.
Round 2: Pairs (A,B), (G,D). Gamma was paired with Delta and won IL.
Round 3: Pairs (A,D), (B,G). Gamma was paired with Beta. G_R2=$19M, B_R2=$21M. Gamma won $1M (IL) from Beta, resulting in G_R3=$20M and B_R3=$20M. This matches the condition.
Round 4: Pairs (A,G), (B,D). Gamma was paired with Alpha and won IH.
Round 5: Pairs (A,B), (G,D). Gamma was paired with Delta and lost IL.
Round 6: Pairs (A,D), (B,G). Gamma was paired with Beta and lost IH.
The condition is met in Round 3."

Anya's Final AIS = 10 * 1.10 = 11.
Ben's Final AIS = 9 * 1.10 = 9.9.
Clara, Dev, Elara receive no bonus. Their Final AIS = Base AIS.
Final AIS scores: Anya=11, Ben=9.9, Clara=7, Dev=7, Elara=9.
Clue 8 (Exactly one researcher had a final AIS of 9.9) is consistent with Ben's score.

Solution:
From the completed publication matrix:
Anya published in J4.
Ben did not publish in J4.
Clara did not publish in J4.
Dev published in J4.
Elara published in J4.
Total papers published in Journal J4 = 1 (Anya) + 0 (Ben) + 0 (Clara) + 1 (Dev) + 1 (Elara) = 3."

Five researchers – Anya, Ben, Clara, Dev, and Elara – publish papers in four academic journals: J1, J2, J3, and J4. Each researcher published between 1 and 3 papers in total during the year. A researcher cannot publish more than one paper in the same journal in that year.
Each journal has an Impact Factor (IF): J1 (IF=5), J2 (IF=4), J3 (IF=3), J4 (IF=2).
A researcher's Annual Impact Score (AIS) is the sum of the Impact Factors of the journals in which they published.
A ""Collaboration Bonus"" is applied: If Anya and Ben both publish in the same journal, each of their individual AIS scores gets a 10% bonus (calculated on their base AIS from sum of IFs). This bonus applies for each such common journal.

Clue 8 (Exactly one researcher had a final AIS of 9.9) is consistent with Ben's score.

Solution:
The final AIS scores are:
Anya: 11
Ben: 9.9
Elara: 9
Clara: 7
Dev: 7
Ranking these scores from highest to lowest: 11 (Anya), 9.9 (Ben), 9 (Elara), 7 (Clara & Dev).

Solution:
The original Collaboration Bonus rule (Anya & Ben) is replaced for this question.
New rule: ""If Clara and Elara both publish in Journal J2, each of them receives a 10% bonus on their base AIS. No other collaboration bonuses apply.""
Elara's publications: J2 (IF=4), J3 (IF=3), J4 (IF=2). Elara's Base AIS = 4+3+2 = 9.
Clara's publications: J2 (IF=4), J3 (IF=3).
Clara and Elara both published in Journal J2.
Under the new rule, Elara receives a 10% bonus on her base AIS.
Elara's new final AIS = 9 * 1.10 = 9.9.
(Clara would also receive a bonus, but the question asks for Elara's AIS)."
