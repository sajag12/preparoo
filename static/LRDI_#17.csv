"LRDI","40","MOCKFNL017_Q1","1","MOCKFNL017_Set1_Alchemist","Four alchemists – Aurum, Beryl, Cinnabar, and Digen – compete in a transmutation game. The game consists of exactly 3 rounds for all alchemists, unless they create a Philosopher's Stone Shard (PS), in which case their game ends immediately after that round, and they do not participate in subsequent rounds.

**Game Rules:**
1.  Starting Resources: Each alchemist starts with 100 units of Lead (Pb) and 100 Energy Points (PP).
2.  Transmutation Options (An alchemist attempts exactly one type of transmutation per round they participate in):
    *   Silver (Ag): Converts 10 Pb into 1 Ag. Costs 5 PP. Yields 2 Victory Points (VP).
    *   Gold (Au): Converts 20 Pb into 1 Au. Costs 15 PP. Yields 5 VP.
    *   Philosopher's Stone Shard (PS): Converts 30 Pb into 1 PS. Costs 30 PP. Yields 10 VP.
3.  Spell Success: An attempted transmutation is successful only if the alchemist has sufficient Pb and PP for that specific transmutation at the start of the round. If an attempt would fail due to insufficient resources for that specific transmutation, they do nothing that round (no VP gain, no resource cost for that round).
4.  Objective: Each alchemist, in each round they participate, chooses the transmutation that maximizes their own total VP by the end of their participation. If multiple spell choices in a round lead to the same maximum final VP outcome over their entire game, they prefer the choice that leaves them with more remaining PP at the end of their game. If remaining PP is also tied, they prefer Ag, then Au, then PS for that round's action.
5.  All resource units (Pb, PP) and VP are integers.

**The following information details the actual choices made by the alchemists in this particular game. These choices should be taken as given facts for solving the questions.**

**Information about a specific game:**
i. Cinnabar created a Philosopher's Stone Shard (PS) and did so in Round 1.
ii. Aurum only created Silver (Ag) throughout the game, cast one Silver (Ag) spell in each of the three rounds, and thus spent 15 PP in total.
iii. Beryl cast Gold (Au) in Round 1, Gold (Au) in Round 2, and Gold (Au) in Round 3.
iv. Digen did not create any Gold (Au). Digen cast Silver (Ag) in Round 1 and Silver (Ag) in Round 2. In Round 3, Digen cast a Philosopher's Stone Shard (PS).

1.  A (Eng CP) = 30 (from Info 1).
2.  D (Hum PF) = 5 (from Info 3).
3.  Total JP = 90 (from Info 2). We know Eng JP = 40 and Hum JP = 25 from Table 1.
    So, B (Sci JP) = Total JP - Eng JP - Hum JP = 90 - 40 - 25 = 25.

Now we can calculate the TRU for each department:
*   E (Eng TRU) = (40 × 5) + (30 × 2) + (15 × 10) = 200 + 60 + 150 = 410.
*   G (Sci TRU) = (25 × 5) + (70 × 2) + (10 × 10) = 125 + 140 + 100 = 365.
*   H (Hum TRU) = (25 × 5) + (50 × 2) + (5 × 10) = 125 + 100 + 50 = 275.
(Check: Total TRU = 410 + 365 + 275 = 1050, which matches Info 5).

Now calculate other missing values:
*   C (Sci Faculty Strength): We know G (Sci TRU) = 365 and Sci TRU per Faculty = 18.25. So, C = 365 / 18.25 = 20.
*   F (Eng TRU per Fac) = E / Eng Fac Strength = 410 / 25 = 16.4.
*   I (Hum TRU per Fac) = H / Hum Fac Strength = 275 / 20 = 13.75.
(Check: F = I + 2.65 => 16.4 = 13.75 + 2.65, which is correct and matches Info 4).

From step 3 of the analysis, the number of Journal Publications for the Science department (B) is 25."

3.  W (France, Pasta) sits between T and U, clockwise from T (T-W-U). W is also from France and prefers Pasta. (Clue 6). With U at 5 and R at 6, this means W must be at seat 4 and T at seat 3.

8.  Q (Brazil, Steak)

Let's check each statement:
A) T is from Egypt and prefers Tacos. - True, from the arrangement.
B) The representative from Denmark prefers Paella. - True, R is from Denmark and prefers Paella.
C) V is from Hungary and prefers Biryani. - True, from the arrangement.
D) S sits opposite W. - S is at seat 2. W is at seat 4. The person opposite S (seat 2) would be at seat 6 (R). So, this statement is false."

Initial Grid from given clues:

Row 2: (D3,M2) (D1,M3) ( , )   (D2,M4)
Row 3: ( , )   (D3,M1) (D2,M4) (D1,M2)
Row 4: (D2,M4) ( , )   ( , )   (D3,M1)

Let's deduce the empty cells based on the rules (each row/column must have one of each D1-D4 and M1-M4).

**Step 1: Cell (1,4)**
- Row 1 Civilizations: D1, D2, D3 are used. D4 (Delta) must be in (1,4).
- Row 1 Materials: M1, M4, M2 are used. M3 (Bronze) must be in (1,4).
- So, (1,4) is (D4, M3) = (Delta, Bronze).

**Step 2: Complete the grid (for other questions)**
- **Cell (3,1):** Col 1 has D1, D3, D2. Needs D4. Col 1 has M1, M2, M4. Needs M3. So (3,1) is (D4, M3).
- **Cell (2,3):** Row 2 has D3, D1, D2. Needs D4. Row 2 has M2, M3, M4. Needs M1. So (2,3) is (D4, M1).
- **Cell (4,2):** Col 2 has D2, D1, D3. Needs D4. Col 2 has M4, M3, M1. Needs M2. So (4,2) is (D4, M2).
- **Cell (4,3):** Row 4 has D2, D4, D3. Needs D1. Row 4 has M4, M2, M1. Needs M3. So (4,3) is (D1, M3).
