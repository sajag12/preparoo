An e-commerce platform processes orders for five product categories: Electronics (E), Apparel (A), Books (B), Home Goods (H), and Groceries (G). Each order goes through up to five processing stages sequentially: Order Verification (OV), Item Picking (IP), Quality Check (QC), Packaging (P), and Dispatch (D). Stage times are in hours. Orders are classified into three priority tiers: Express, Standard, and Economy, which can affect processing. Not all stages are applicable to all categories or priorities (e.g., Groceries skip QC).

Information Provided (Partial Data):
The following table shows some typical stage times. ""Spec."" packaging is for Electronics and some Home Goods orders and uses a dedicated resource; ""Std."" packaging is for others. Groceries do not undergo Quality Check (QC Time = 0).

Category	Priority	OV Time (hr)	IP Time (hr)	QC Time (hr)	Packaging Type	P Time (hr)	D Time (hr)	Total Time (hr)
Electronics	Express	0.5	1.0	0.75	Spec.	1.0	0.25	E_Exp_Total

An online learning platform tracked 10,000 initial Website Visits (WV) over a period. These visits were attributed to one of four primary marketing channels: Organic Search (OS), Social Media (SM), Email Campaign (EC), or Referrals (R). Visitors could then progress to a Free Trial Sign-up (FT), then to a Paid Subscription (PS), and finally to an Advanced Module Add-on (AM). Conversion rates for FT are calculated based on WV from that channel. Conversion rates for PS are calculated based on FT users from that channel. Conversion rates for AM are calculated based on PS users from that channel.

Innovate University tracked its Class of 2000 alumni. Initially, the class had 100 graduates from Engineering (Eng), 150 from Business (Bus), 80 from Arts & Humanities (AH), and 120 from Sciences (Sci). Their career progression was assessed at four checkpoints: 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020. At each checkpoint, the number of tracked alumni from each original Field of Study (FOS) was noted, and their primary engagement was categorized into one of six milestones: Entry-Level (EL), Mid-Management (MM), Senior Leadership (SL), Entrepreneur (EN), Further Education (FE), or Other/Unaccounted (O). All percentages are based on the number of tracked alumni for that FOS at that specific checkpoint year. Assume no alumni switch their original FOS category for tracking purposes. All calculated numbers of alumni for any category must be integers; if a calculation from a percentage results in a non-integer, round it to the nearest integer (0.5 rounds up). The 'Other/Unaccounted' (O) category number for a given FOS and year is the 'Tracked Alumni' for that FOS/year minus the sum of the integer numbers of alumni in the other five categories (EL, MM, SL, EN, FE) for that FOS/year. Blank percentages in the tables (e.g., FE_E05) must be determined from the clues.

All Questions,40,CATMOCKDLR003_Q19,19,CATMOCKDLR003_Set5_WorkshopScheduling,"Introductory Text:
A one-day event features six distinct 2-hour workshops: W1 (""AI in Marketing"" - AIM), W2 (""Data Storytelling"" - DS), W3 (""Agile Methodologies"" - AM), W4 (""Blockchain Basics"" - BB), W5 (""UX Design Thinking"" - UXDT), and W6 (""Cloud Security"" - CS).
There are three available time slots: TS1 (9-11 AM), TS2 (11:30 AM - 1:30 PM), and TS3 (2:30 PM - 4:30 PM).
There are three available rooms: R1 (Capacity 50, equipped with Projector only), R2 (Capacity 30, equipped with Whiteboard only), and R3 (Capacity 40, equipped with both Projector & Whiteboard).
Each workshop must be assigned to exactly one room and one time slot. A room can host only one workshop per time slot.

Workshop Requirements & Facilitators:

W1 (AIM): Needs Projector. Facilitated by F1.
W2 (DS): Needs Projector AND Whiteboard. Facilitated by F2.
W3 (AM): Needs Whiteboard. Facilitated by F3.
W4 (BB): Needs Projector. Facilitated by F1.
W5 (UXDT): Needs Whiteboard. Facilitated by F4.
W6 (CS): Needs Projector. Facilitated by F5.

Additional Information (Clues):

1.  Each of the five facilitators (F1, F2, F3, F4, F5) can only facilitate one workshop at any given time. Facilitator F1 is assigned to facilitate two workshops (W1 and W4) during the day.
2.  All six workshops are scheduled within the first two time slots (TS1 and TS2); Time Slot TS3 remains entirely empty.
3.  Workshop W2 (""Data Storytelling"") is scheduled in Room R3.
4.  Workshop W3 (""Agile Methodologies"") is scheduled in Time Slot TS1 but not in Room R1.
5.  Workshop W1 (""AI in Marketing"") and Workshop W4 (""Blockchain Basics"") are scheduled in the same room but in different time slots.
6.  Workshop W6 (""Cloud Security"") is not scheduled in Time Slot TS1. Facilitator F4 (for W5) is busy in Time Slot TS2.
7.  Workshop W1 (""AI in Marketing"") is scheduled in an earlier time slot than Workshop W4 (""Blockchain Basics"").",Which workshop is scheduled in Room R1 during Time Slot TS1?,W1 (AIM),W2 (DS),W4 (BB),W6 (CS),A,B,C,D,A,MCQ,Logical Reasoning,"Scheduling, Constraint Satisfaction",Moderate,Deducing a specific assignment in a scheduling puzzle by synthesizing multiple constraints.,"time slot allocation, resource matching, facilitator constraints, sequential constraints",False,CATMOCKDLR003_Set5_WorkshopScheduling,Analysis,"Based on Clues 1, 5, and 7, W1 (facilitated by F1) and W4 (also by F1) must be in different time slots. Since W1 is earlier, W1 is in TS1 and W4 is in TS2. They are in the same room. W2 needs both Projector & Whiteboard, so it must be in R3. Clue 3 confirms W2 is in R3. Since W2 must be in TS1 or TS2, we can determine the schedule. The only way to satisfy all constraints is to place W4 (needs P) in R1-TS2, which means W1 must be in R1-TS1 to be in the same room. W6 (needs P) is in TS2 (Clue 6), and R3 is the only remaining room with a projector in TS2, so W6 is in R3-TS2. This forces W2 into R3-TS1. Thus, W1 is in Room R1, Time Slot TS1."

This means W5 cannot be scheduled in TS2 and must be in TS1. We have deduced that in TS1, W1 is in R1 and W2 is in R3. The only remaining room for W5 in TS1 is R2. Room R2 has a whiteboard, which matches the requirement for W5. Therefore, W5 is scheduled in Room R2, Time Slot TS1."

Therefore, facilitators F1, F2, and F3 are busy. Facilitators F4 and F5 are facilitating workshops in TS2, which means they are free during TS1. Of the options provided, F5 is listed."

W7 requires a Projector. We need to find a room with a projector that is free in TS3. Room R1 has a Projector and is free in TS3. Room R2 has only a Whiteboard, so it's not suitable. Room R3 has a Projector and is also free in TS3. Of the given options, 'Room R1, Time Slot TS3' is a valid and possible combination."
