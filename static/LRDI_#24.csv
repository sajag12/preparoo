LRDI,40,MOCKCATDILR002_Q1,1,MOCKCATDILR002_Set1,"A study tracked 500 startups, initiated in Year 0, across three distinct sectors: FinTech, HealthTech, and EdTech. The study followed these startups for 10 years, evaluating their status (Survived to Next Stage, Failed, or Acquired) and funding at biennial checkpoints (Year 2, 4, 6, 8, 10). Startups progressed through Seed, Series A, Series B, and Series C funding stages before a final Exit/Acquired status assessment in Year 10 for those still active. All funding amounts are in millions of currency units. All counts of startups are integers.

Initial Distribution (Year 0):
FinTech: 200 startups
HealthTech: 150 startups
The number of EdTech startups was equal to the number of HealthTech startups.

(Cells with letters A-M are unknowns to be deduced. Startups that survive one stage become the entrants for that sector in the next stage evaluation two years later. E.g., FinTech startups surviving Seed stage in Year 2 are the ones entering Series A stage evaluation in Year 4.)

Additional Information:
1.  At each stage (Seed, A, B, C), for any sector, Startups Entered = Startups Survived to Next Stage + Startups Failed at Stage + Startups Acquired at Stage.
2.  The total number of startups that failed at the Seed stage across all sectors was 165.
3.  The number of FinTech startups acquired at Series A was the same as the number acquired at Series B and Series C. This number was 10.
4.  For HealthTech startups, the number that survived Series A to enter Series B (i.e., survived Series A at Year 4) was twice the number that survived Series B to enter Series C (i.e., survived Series B at Year 6).
5.  The total funding raised by FinTech survivors at Series B was 250 million.
6.  Exactly 45 startups in total across all sectors were in the ""Exit/Acquired"" status at the Year 10 evaluation (these are the survivors from Series C). Of these, the number of EdTech startups was 5.
7.  The number of FinTech startups that survived Series C (K) was three times the number of HealthTech startups that survived Series C to be evaluated at Year 10 (M).
8.  For EdTech startups at the Series B stage, the number of Acquired startups was one-fourth the number of Failed startups.
9.  At the Series C stage, the number of Acquired HealthTech startups was equal to the number of Acquired FinTech startups.
10. For EdTech startups at the Series C stage, the number of Acquired startups was equal to the number of Failed startups.",What was the number of EdTech startups that were Acquired at the Seed stage (D)?,10,15,20,25,10,15,20,25,15,MCQ,Data Interpretation,"Table Analysis, Cohort Analysis",Moderate,Cohort Analysis and Data Deduction from Tables,"data deduction, arithmetic, cohort tracking",False,MOCKCATDILR002_Set1_StartupLifecycle,Analysis,"First, determine the initial number of startups: FinTech (FT) = 200, HealthTech (HT) = 150, EdTech (ET) = 150.

The key to this question is connecting the EdTech data between Series B and Series C.

**Year 6 - Series B Stage:**
*   FT: Acquired = 10 (Clue 3).
*   HT: Acquired = 10 (from table).
*   ET: Entered = 40. From Clue 8, Acquired_ET_B = (1/4) * Failed_ET_B. We also know Entered = Survived + Failed + Acquired. So, 40 = Survived_ET_B + Failed_ET_B + (1/4)Failed_ET_B.

**Year 8 - Series C Stage:**
*   We deduce ET_Survived_C = 5 (from Clue 6) and ET_Entered_C = Survived_ET_B. From Clue 10, Acquired_ET_C = Failed_ET_C. So, Survived_ET_B = 5 + 2 * Failed_ET_C.

**Combining EdTech Information:**
We need to find an integer solution. Trying values for Acquired_ET_B (which dictates Failed_ET_B), we test against the options for the total acquisition number.
Total Acq_SeriesB = Acq_FT_B + Acq_HT_B + Acq_ET_B = 10 + 10 + Acq_ET_B = 20 + Acq_ET_B.
If we check the option (B) 27, this implies Acq_ET_B = 7. If Acq_ET_B = 7, then Failed_ET_B = 4 * 7 = 28. Then Survived_ET_B = 40 - 28 - 7 = 5. This value of Survived_ET_B (5) is consistent with the Series C data, as 5 = 5 + 2*Failed_ET_C implies Failed_ET_C = 0, which is a valid integer. 

Therefore, the number of EdTech startups acquired at Series B is 7.
Total Acquired at Series B = 10 (FT) + 10 (HT) + 7 (ET) = 27."

From Clue 3, the daily totals are a strictly increasing sequence S1 < S2 < S3 < S4 < S5, where S3 = S2 + 1.
From Clue 1, on Day 1, L1, T1, P1, K1 are all >= 1. From Clue 2, K1 > P1. So the minimum possible total for Day 1 is L1=1, T1=1, P1=1, K1=2, which gives S1 >= 5.
The maximum possible total for any day is 3*4=12.
We need to find a sequence of 5 strictly increasing integers (S1, S2, S3, S4, S5) that sum to 40, with S1>=5, S5<=12 and S3=S2+1.
Let's test possible starting values for S1:
- If S1=5, S2=6, S3=7. Then S4+S5 = 40-18=22. A possible sequence is (5,6,7,10,12). Let's check S5=12. On Day 5, K5=P5 (Clue 2). The total is L5+T5+2*P5 = 12. Since L, T <= 3, L5+T5 <= 6. This implies 2*P5 >= 6, so P5 >= 3. This contradicts Clue 4 (max P is 2). So this sequence is not possible.
- If S1=6, S2=7, S3=8. Then S4+S5 = 40-21=19. A possible sequence is (6,7,8,9,10). Let's check S5=10. On Day 5, K5=P5. L5+T5+2*P5=10. L5+T5<=6, so 2*P5>=4, P5>=2. Since max P is 2, P5 must be 2. This is a consistent sequence.

Clue 4: Pesmisto (P) has a total of 7 requests, with a max of 2 on exactly two days. This means the daily requests for P are {2, 2, 1, 1, 1} in some order.
Day 5: S5=10. K5=P5. L5+T5+2*P5=10. Since L,T<=3, L5+T5<=6. So 2*P5>=4 -> P5>=2. Since max P is 2, P5 must be 2. So, Day 5 is one of the days Pesmisto logged 2 requests.
This eliminates options A and B.
We need to determine the other day. Let's place the remaining requests for P {2, 1, 1, 1} on Days 1-4.
Day 1: S1=6. P1>=1, K1>P1. If P1=2, then K1 must be 3. L1+T1+2+3=6 -> L1+T1=1. This is impossible as L1,T1>=1. So P1 cannot be 2. Therefore, P1=1.
This means the second day with 2 requests must be Day 2, 3, or 4. The options are Day 3 or Day 4. Let's assume P3=2. The daily values for P would be [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]. This is a valid distribution.

(A) Levmisto logged 3 requests on Day 1. From the solution for Q8, L1=1. So, this is false.
(B) Kitmisto logged 2 requests on Day 5. From Clue 2 (K5=P5) and Clue 4 (max P=2), and the daily total S5=10 (L5+T5+2P5=10), we uniquely deduced that P5=2 and therefore K5=2. This is necessarily true.
(C) Pesmisto logged 2 requests on Day 2. We deduced P1=1, so P2 can be 1 or 2. In our final grid, P2=1. So, this is not necessarily true.
(D) Tyhrmisto logged 1 request on Day 3. In our final grid, T3=2. The pair (L3,T3) could have been (1,2) or (2,1). So T3 is not uniquely determined. This is not necessarily true.

From the solution to Q14, we know X (PM Enrollments in 2021) = 500.
From Table 1, the total new enrollments in 2021 is 2300.
Total = DS + PM + DM + CS

2300 = 1800 + Y
Y = 2300 - 1800 = 500.

Method 2: Using Total Dropouts (Clue 2)
Dropout Rate = 100% - Completion Rate.
- DS Dropouts 2021 = 600 * (1 - 0.65) = 600 * 0.35 = 210.
- PM Dropouts 2021 = 500 * (1 - 0.70) = 500 * 0.30 = 150.
- DM Dropouts 2021 = 700 * (1 - 0.60) = 700 * 0.40 = 280.
- CS Dropouts 2021 = Y * (1 - 0.80) = Y * 0.20.
Total Dropouts = 210 + 150 + 280 + 0.20*Y = 640 + 0.20*Y.

Such questions in CAT are typically designed to test if you can stick to the deductions that are independent of the hypothetical condition. The question does not ask to re-solve the puzzle with a new rule, but rather asks for a property of S1 based on the solved puzzle.

From our base solution, we have uniquely determined the properties of all sculptures:
- S1: Metal, RS=4, VAS=5
- S2: Metal, RS=1, VAS=9
- S5: Metal, RS=7, VAS=1

The metal sculptures are S1, S2, and S5. Their rarity scores are 4, 1, and 7. The one with the highest Rarity Score is S5 (RS=7), not S2. The premise 'If the sculpture with the highest Rarity Score among Metal sculptures is S2' is contrary to the facts established by the clues.

However, the question asks for the Visitor Appeal Score of S1. This value has been uniquely determined as 5 during the solving process, independent of which sculpture has the highest rarity score among metal ones.
- From Clue 7: Total VAS of Metal (S1, S2, S5) = 15. VAS(S5)=1. So, VAS(S1)+VAS(S2)=14.
- From Clue 4: The sum of VAS for S1 and S2 is 14. This is consistent.
- The only available unique integer pairs that sum to 14 are {5,9} and {6,8} and {4,10} etc., but we must exclude used VAS values (1,4,6). This leaves {5,9} as the only viable pair for {VAS(S1), VAS(S2)}.
- The specific assignment of 5 to S1 and 9 to S2 (or vice versa) is determined by other constraints leading to the final unique grid.

In the final unique solution, VAS(S1) is 5. We provide this established value. The hypothetical part is a distractor."
