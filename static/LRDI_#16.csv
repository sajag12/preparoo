    *   Rule 1: Elysian 1 is from 4th C BCE. Elysian 2 is not from 3rd C BCE.
    *   Rule 2: Drakonian is from 5th C BCE.
    *   Rule 10 states all four centuries (3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th BCE) are used.
    *   Rule 8: No Solarian artifact is from the 6th C BCE.
    *   The Elysian artifacts are: (E, 4th C). The other Elysian cannot be 3rd C. It also cannot be 5th C (used by Drakonian). Since all centuries are used and Solarian is not 6th C, the second Elysian must be from the 6th Century BCE. So, Elysian artifacts are (E, 4th C) and (E, 6th C).
    *   The remaining centuries are 3rd and a slot for Solarian. The 3rd Century slot must be filled.
    *   Rule 9: The two Solarian artifacts were created in consecutive centuries. Since 6th C is not Solarian, and 5th C is Drakonian, and one Elysian is 4th C, the Solarians cannot be 5th-6th or 4th-5th.

2.  **Assign Artifact IDs:**
    *   Rule 3: A3 is Solarian and created in an earlier century than A4 (Solarian).
        *   Therefore, A3 = (S, 3rd C) and A4 = (S, 4th C).
    *   Rule 6: The artifact from the 3rd Century BCE is not A4. (Consistent, as A3 is from 3rd C).
    *   Rule 4: A1 is either (E, 6th C) or (S, 3rd C). Since A3 is (S, 3rd C), A1 must be (E, 6th C).
    *   So far: A1=(E, 6thC), A3=(S, 3rdC), A4=(S, 4thC).
    *   Remaining artifacts: A2, A5. Remaining (Civ, Century) slots: (E, 4th C) and (D, 5th C).
    *   Rule 5: A2 is not Drakonian. So, A2 cannot be (D, 5th C). Therefore, A2 = (E, 4th C).
    *   This leaves A5 to be (D, 5th C).
    *   Check remaining rules:
        *   Rule 5: A5 is not from the 3rd Century BCE. (True, A5 is from 5th C).
        *   Rule 7: If A5 is Solarian, then it is from the 4th Century BCE. (A5 is Drakonian, so the condition ""A5 is Solarian"" is false, hence the statement is true).

3.  **Final Assignment:**
    *   A1: Elysian, 6th Century BCE

1.  Primary Goal (Maximize Minimum): The algorithm first tries to assign tasks such that the minimum CS among all assigned pairs is maximized.
2.  Secondary Goal (Maximize Total if Min is Tied): If multiple assignment sets achieve the same maximized minimum CS (from Rule 1), the algorithm then chooses, from among these sets, the one that maximizes the total sum of CS for the five assigned pairs.

- Can min CS be 8? We need an assignment where all scores are >= 8. Let's try to build one:
  - E1 -> T1 (8)
  - E2 -> T2 (9)
  - E3 -> T5 (8)
  - E5 -> T3 (8)
