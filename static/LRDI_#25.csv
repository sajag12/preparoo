LRDI,40,MOCKCAT24S3GEN_Q1,1,DiseaseProgressionStudy,"A 30-year epidemiological study was initiated in the year 2000 to observe the progression of a specific chronic disease. The study enrolled 1200 individuals, comprising 600 males and 600 females. At the start of the study in 2000, these individuals were distributed equally across three age bands: 20 to less than 30 years, 30 to less than 40 years, and 40 to less than 50 years. Thus, for each gender, there were 200 individuals in each of these three age bands.

Within each gender and initial age band, 100 individuals were assigned to receive ""Treatment X"" (T), and the other 100 individuals were assigned to a ""Placebo"" group (P). The study tracked these individuals for thirty years or until their death, whichever occurred first. The number of individuals still alive was recorded at decennial checkpoints: 2010, 2020, and 2030.

The tables below depict the number of individuals from the initial cohort who were still alive at each checkpoint, categorized by their age group at that point in time, their gender, and whether they were in the Treatment X or Placebo group. For example, in 2010, among males who were originally in the 20 to <30 age band in 2000 (and thus were 30 to <40 in 2010), 90 individuals from the Treatment X group were alive.

LRDI,40,MOCKCAT24S3GEN_Q5,5,DiseaseProgressionStudy,"A 30-year epidemiological study was initiated in the year 2000 to observe the progression of a specific chronic disease. The study enrolled 1200 individuals, comprising 600 males and 600 females. At the start of the study in 2000, these individuals were distributed equally across three age bands: 20 to less than 30 years, 30 to less than 40 years, and 40 to less than 50 years. Thus, for each gender, there were 200 individuals in each of these three age bands.

Within each gender and initial age band, 100 individuals were assigned to receive ""Treatment X"" (T), and the other 100 individuals were assigned to a ""Placebo"" group (P). The study tracked these individuals for thirty years or until their death, whichever occurred first. The number of individuals still alive was recorded at decennial checkpoints: 2010, 2020, and 2030.

The tables below depict the number of individuals from the initial cohort who were still alive at each checkpoint, categorized by their age group at that point in time, their gender, and whether they were in the Treatment X or Placebo group. For example, in 2010, among males who were originally in the 20 to <30 age band in 2000 (and thus were 30 to <40 in 2010), 90 individuals from the Treatment X group were alive.

No other combinations are possible, and a state does not issue permits to itself.

Clues/Additional Information:

1.  In Week 1, S1 issued Business permits to S2, and both Business and Tourist permits to S3.
2.  Over the four weeks, S2 issued a total of 3 Business permits and 3 Tourist permits to S3. S2 issued both Business and Tourist permits to S3 in Week 2 and Week 3.
3.  S1 issued only Business permits to S4 in Week 2 and issued only Business permits to S4 in Week 3. S1 issued no permits to S4 in Week 1 and Week 4. (This implies S4 received a total of 2 Business permits and 0 Tourist permits from S1 over the four weeks).

From Clue 1, S1 issues B (1 Business type) to S2 in W1.
2.  From Clue 6, S1 issues BT (1 Business type, 1 Tourist type; total 2 permit types) to S2 in W2.
3.  From Clue 6, S1 issues B (1 Business type) to S2 in W4, as it's the same as W1.
4.  The problem requires determining S1's issuance to S2 in W3. This involves creating a complete schedule of permit issuances for all state pairs across all four weeks that is consistent with all given clues.
5.  Key fixed points for S1's issuances are:
    *   S1 to S2: W1(B), W2(BT), W4(B).
    *   S1 to S4: W1(0), W2(B), W3(B), W4(0) (Clue 3).
    *   S1 to S3: W1(BT) (Clue 1).
6.  The overall system must adhere to Clue 7, stating S1 receives a total of 10 Business permit types and 8 Tourist permit types from S2, S3, and S4.
7.  When attempting to complete the full schedule, it is found that if S1 issues any permits (either B or BT) to S2 in W3, it leads to a contradiction. Specifically, it becomes impossible for the combination of S2, S3, and S4 to issue the precise total of 10 Business and 8 Tourist permits to S1 (as required by Clue 7) without violating one or more other conditions. These conditions include the specific issuances fixed by other clues (like Clue 2 for S2->S3, Clue 4 for S3's W3 output, Clue 5 for S4->S2) or the fundamental rule that a state can only issue 0, B, or BT permits in a given week to another state.
8.  Therefore, through a process of elimination driven by the need to satisfy all constraints simultaneously, particularly Clue 7, the only valid assignment for S1's issuance to S2 in W3 is 0 permit types."

V1 (Year1 VP candidate) received a total of 55 votes (Clue 2).
2.  Let V1_Y1 be votes V1 received from Year1 students, and V1_Y2 be votes V1 received from Year2 students.
3.  From Clue 6: V1_Y2 = V1_Y1 + 5.
4.  We know V1_Y1 + V1_Y2 = 55 (total votes for V1).
5.  Substituting (3) into (4): V1_Y1 + (V1_Y1 + 5) = 55
    => 2 * V1_Y1 + 5 = 55
    => 2 * V1_Y1 = 50
    => V1_Y1 = 25 votes.
6.  So, V1_Y2 = 25 + 5 = 30 votes.
7.  Now consider V2 (Year2 VP candidate). V2 received 15 votes from Year1 students (Clue 2).
8.  There are 60 Year2 student voters. Votes for V2 from Year2 students = Total Year2 voters - Votes for V1 from Year2 students
    = 60 - 30 = 30 votes.
9.  Total votes for V2 = Votes for V2 from Year1 + Votes for V2 from Year2
    = 15 + 30 = 45 votes.
10. Comparing total votes: V1 = 55 votes, V2 = 45 votes. V1 won.
11. President: P2 total = 45 (from Y2) + 15 (from Y1) = 60. P1 total = 100-60=40. P2 (Y2) wins.
12. Treasurer: T2 (Y2) won with 65 votes (Clue 3). T1 got 35 votes. T2 (Y2) wins.
