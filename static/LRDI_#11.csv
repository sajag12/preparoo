"Part 1: All Questions","","MOCKXYZ001_Q1","1","MOCKXYZ001_Set1_GrandSlam","The Grand Slam Tennis Tournament is a 64-player single-elimination knockout event. Players are seeded from 1 (highest) to 64 (lowest) before the first round. In any match, if an upset does not occur, the higher-seeded player (lower numerical seed value) wins. An upset occurs if a lower-seeded player (higher numerical seed value) defeats a higher-seeded player. The tournament has 6 rounds (Round 1, Round 2, Round 3, Quarterfinals, Semifinals, Final).
Additional Information:
1.	The total number of upsets in the entire tournament was exactly 5.
2.	No player seeded 33 or lower won more than one match in the tournament. Any player seeded 33 or lower who won a match in Round 1 was eliminated in Round 2 by a player seeded in the top 32.
3.	Exactly two players seeded in the top 8 lost in Round 1. Both were defeated by players seeded between 33 and 40 (inclusive).
4.	The player seeded 1 won the tournament by defeating player seeded 6 in the Final.
5.	Player seeded 2 lost in a Semifinal match to player seeded 1.
6.	Player seeded 3 won their first two matches and was then eliminated in Round 3 by player seeded 14. Player seeded 14 was subsequently eliminated in the Quarterfinals.
7.	Exactly one player seeded between 9 and 16 (inclusive) reached the Quarterfinals. This player was seeded 14.
8.	Of the 5 upsets in the tournament, two occurred in Round 1 (as per clue 3). Of the remaining three upsets, exactly two occurred in Round 2 and these involved a player seeded 9-16 losing to a player seeded 17-32. The final upset occurred in Round 3.","What was the lowest possible seed of a player who reached the Quarterfinals?","14","19","20","21","A","B","C","D","D","MCQ","Logical Reasoning","Games & Tournaments, Knockout Tournament","Difficult","constraint satisfaction, tournament structure, seeding, upsets, logical deduction, path reconstruction","constraint satisfaction, tournament structure, seeding, upsets, logical deduction, path reconstruction","False","MOCKXYZ001_Set1_GrandSlam","Logical Deduction","1. Based on the deduction above, the QFists are 5 from Top-8, S14, and two from 17-32 (e.g., S_Upset_17/32_C and S_Upset_17/32_D).
2. Let's consider specific seeds for the two 17-32 QFists. They caused upsets in R2 against 9-16 seeds. Suppose S20 (seed 20) beat S12 and S21 (seed 21) beat S11. These are the two players from 17-32 who reach QF.
3. The group of QFist seeds would be {S1, S2, S6, T8_Rem1, T8_Rem2 (e.g., S4, S7)}, {S14}, {S20, S21}.
4. The lowest seed (highest numerical value) among these example QF seeds is 21.
    If S19 and S20 were the 17-32 QFists, lowest would be 20. If S21 and S22 were the 17-32 QFists, lowest would be 22.
    To find the *lowest possible seed*, we want the highest numerical value among the two 17-32 QFists. Standard tournament pairings often try to make sums of seeds in a round section consistent. E.g., in a section of 16, seed 9 plays 24, 10 plays 23, 11 plays 22, 12 plays 21. If seed 21 (17-32 range) upsets seed 12 (9-16 range), and seed 22 (17-32 range) upsets seed 11 (9-16 range), then 21 and 22 are potential QFists from this group.
    If S21 and S22 reach QF, the lowest seed among all QFists is S22.
    Consider pairings in R2: (9 vs 24), (10 vs 23), (11 vs 22), (12 vs 21), (13 vs 20), (14 vs 19), (15 vs 18), (16 vs 17).
    If the two R2 upsets are by S21 (def. S12) and S20 (def. S13), then S20 and S21 reach QF (after their R3 wins). The highest numerical seed among QFists would be 21.
    Thus, the lowest seed (highest numerical value) that can reach the QF from this group is 21. (If S17-S32 were S_Upset_C and S_Upset_D, the max possible seed is 32. But they must beat seeds from 9-16. For S32 to beat S9, S10, ... S16 is possible).
    The question asks for the lowest possible seed (highest numerical value). The player seeds from the 17-32 group that reach QF are S_Upset_17/32_C and S_Upset_17/32_D. The highest these could be is S32, but they would need to beat someone from 9-16 and then win R3. Example QF list seeds: S1, S2, S4, S6, S7, S14, S20, S21. Lowest seed here is 21.
    This fits option D."

2. QF Matches (no upsets allowed here as all 5 are accounted for):

3. Semifinalists are the winners: S1, S2, S6, and T8_Rem1 (a Top-8 seed).
4. All four semifinalists are from the Top-8 seeds. Therefore, no player seeded 17-32 reached the Semifinals. This statement (B) MUST be true.
5. Let's check other options:
    A) Player seeded 4 reached the Semifinals. Not necessarily. S4 could be one of T8_Loser1 or T8_Loser2 (eliminated R1). If S4 is not an R1 loser, S4 would be T8_Rem1 (if S4 is the highest seed among T8_Rem1, T8_Rem2) and would reach SF. But if, for example, S4 and S5 were R1 losers, then T8_Rem1 would be S7 (assuming S7 def. S8 in QF), so S4 wouldn't reach SF. Thus, A is not ""MUST be true"".
    C) Player seeded 7 was eliminated in the Quarterfinals. Not necessarily. If S4 and S5 were R1 losers, then T8_Rem1 could be S7 (def. S8 in QF), and S7 would reach SF. If S7 was an R1 loser, it was eliminated in R1. If S7 was T8_Rem2 and lost to S4 (T8_Rem1) in QF, then C is true. Since S7's fate varies, C is not ""MUST be true"".
    D) Player seeded 14 won exactly two matches. S14 won R1 (no upset), R2 (no upset), and R3 (upset vs S3). That's 3 wins before losing in QF. So, D is false.

3. If S4 is not an R1 loser: S4 is one of T8_Remaining1 or T8_Remaining2. The pool for these two and the two R1 Top-8 losers is {S4, S5, S7, S8}.
4. S4 is the highest seed in this pool {S4,S5,S7,S8}. If S4 is not an R1 loser, S4 must be T8_Remaining1 (the winner of the QF match between T8_Remaining1 and T8_Remaining2). S4 would defeat T8_Remaining2 (e.g., S5, S7, or S8) in the Quarterfinals (no upset).

3. From Q3's reasoning, the player defeated by S6 in the Semifinals is T8_Remaining1 (the higher-seeded player from the T8_Remaining1 vs T8_Remaining2 QF match).
4. The identity of T8_Remaining1 depends on which two Top-8 seeds from {S4, S5, S7, S8} lost in Round 1.
    *   Scenario 1: If S7 and S8 were the R1 losers, then T8_Remaining1 = S4 (who would have beaten S5 in QF). The SF losers are S2 and S4. Sum of their seeds = 2 + 4 = 6.

1. Players seeded 33-64:
    *   Two players seeded 33-40 (S_Upset_33/40_A, S_Upset_33/40_B) caused R1 upsets (Clue 3).
    *   According to Clue 2, these players won only one match (R1) and were eliminated in Round 2. Thus, they did not reach Round 3.

2. Players seeded 17-32:
    *   Two players from this group (S_Upset_17/32_C, S_Upset_17/32_D) caused upsets in R2 against 9-16 seeds (Clue 8). By winning their R2 matches, they reached Round 3. (2 players)
    *   Consider the two players S_Upset_33/40_A and S_Upset_33/40_B (seeds 33-40) who caused upsets in R1. According to Clue 2, these players were then eliminated in R2 by players seeded in the top 32. Let these top-32 winners be P_Top32_X and P_Top32_Y.
    *   P_Top32_X and P_Top32_Y must be from the 17-32 seed range. In a standard draw, an R1 upset winner like S_Upset_33/40_A (e.g., S36 who beat S5) would typically play a seed from the 17-24 or 25-32 range in Round 2 (e.g., S28). S28 (a Top-32 player) defeats S36. This is not an upset for S28.
    *   These two players (P_Top32_X, P_Top32_Y from the 17-32 range) win their R2 matches and thus reach Round 3. These players are distinct from S_Upset_17/32_C and S_Upset_17/32_D because their R2 wins were not upsets. (2 players)
3. Any other player from 17-32, if they won R1, would typically play a 1-16 seed in R2. They would lose unless they caused an upset. All upsets are accounted for (2 in R2 by S_Upset_17/32_C/D, 1 in R3 by S14, 2 in R1 by S33-40). So no other 17-32 seed reaches R3.
4. Total players seeded outside the top 16 reaching Round 3 = 2 (S_Upset_17/32_C and S_Upset_17/32_D) + 2 (P_Top32_X and P_Top32_Y) = 4 players. All these 4 players are from the 17-32 seed range."

•	Axia: Music (8.5), Dance (7.0), Theatre (9.0)
•	Boria: Music (7.5), Comedy (C=8.0), Theatre (8.2)
•	Ceston: Dance (Rating for D audience is 7.8), Comedy (8.8), Music (F=6.5)
Evaluate statements:
A) Boria had the highest average rating across its performances.
    To check this, we calculate the audience-weighted average rating for each city:
    Axia Avg Rating = (500*8.5 + 300*7.0 + 200*9.0) / (500+300+200) = (4250 + 2100 + 1800) / 1000 = 8150 / 1000 = 8.15.
    Boria Avg Rating = (700*7.5 + 400*8.0 + 250*8.2) / (700+400+250) = (5250 + 3200 + 2050) / 1350 = 10500 / 1350 ≈ 7.78.
    Ceston Avg Rating = (450*7.8 + 600*8.8 + 350*6.5) / (450+600+350) = (3510 + 5280 + 2275) / 1400 = 11065 / 1400 ≈ 7.90.
    Axia has the highest average rating (8.15). Statement A is false.

B) Ceston's Music performance had a higher Revenue per Audience than Boria's Music performance.
    Ceston Music: Revenue = 150, Audience = 350. Rev/Aud = 150/350 = 15/35 = 3/7.
    Boria Music: Revenue (B=300), Audience = 700. Rev/Aud = 300/700 = 30/70 = 3/7.
    The Revenue per Audience is equal for both (3/7). Statement B is false.

C) The total cost for all Theatre performances was greater than the total cost for all Dance performances.
    Total Cost Theatre = Cost(Axia Theatre, 80) + Cost(Boria Theatre, 90) = 80 + 90 = 170.
    Total Cost Dance = Cost(Axia Dance, A=90) + Cost(Ceston Dance, 120) = 90 + 120 = 210.
    170 is not greater than 210. Statement C is false.

D) The performance with the highest individual audience rating was in Axia.
    The individual ratings are: Axia [Music 8.5, Dance 7.0, Theatre 9.0], Boria [Music 7.5, Comedy 8.0, Theatre 8.2], Ceston [Dance 7.8, Comedy 8.8, Music 6.5].
    The highest single rating among all these is 9.0, which was for Axia's Theatre performance. This performance was in Axia. Statement D is true."
