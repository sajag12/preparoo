2.  From Clue 4, Row 1 is completely filled and its sum is 10. Since numbers increase L-R (Clue 1) and are distinct integers, Row 1 must be {1, 2, 3, 4}. So, R1C1=1, R1C2=2, R1C3=3, R1C4=4.
3.  From Clue 5, (R2,C1) = 5 and slot (R2,C4) is empty (E).
4.  From Clue 3, (R4,C4) = 12.
5.  From Clue 5, the sum of numbers in Column 1 is 14. We have R1C1=1 and R2C1=5. So, 1 + 5 + R3C1 + R4C1 = 14 (considering only filled cells). This means if both R3C1 and R4C1 are filled, their sum is 8. By Clue 2 (numbers in a column increase T-B), R3C1 > R2C1=5. If R3C1 and R4C1 were both filled, then 5 < R3C1 < R4C1, and R3C1+R4C1=8. No two distinct integers satisfy this. So, one of R3C1 or R4C1 must be empty, and the other must be 8.
6.  From Clue 6, (R4,C2) = 10 and Column 2 is completely filled.
7.  From Clue 7, slot (R3,C3) is empty (E), and the number 11 is in Row 3.
8.  From Clue 8, the sum of numbers in Row 2 is 18. Row 2 is {R2C1, R2C2, R2C3, R2C4}. We have {5, R2C2, R2C3, E}. So, 5 + R2C2 + R2C3 = 18, which means R2C2 + R2C3 = 13. Since numbers increase L-R (Clue 1) and R2C2 > R2C1=5, the only distinct integers for (R2C2, R2C3) are (6,7). So, R2C2=6 and R2C3=7. Row 2 is {5, 6, 7, E}.
9.  From Clue 9, the sum of numbers in Row 3 is 28. Row 3 is {R3C1, R3C2, R3C3, R3C4}. We have {R3C1, R3C2, E, R3C4}. So, R3C1 + R3C2 + R3C4 = 28. We also know 11 is in Row 3.
10. Let's revisit Column 1 (Step 5).
    *   Case A: R3C1=8, R4C1=E.
        Row 3 is {8, R3C2, E, R3C4}. Sum: 8 + R3C2 + R3C4 = 28, so R3C2 + R3C4 = 20.
        Column 2 is {R1C2, R2C2, R3C2, R4C2} = {2, 6, R3C2, 10} and is filled. Numbers increase T-B. So, 6 < R3C2 < 10. Possible values for R3C2 are 7, 8, 9.
        Since R3C1=8, R3C2 must be > 8 (Clue 1: L-R increase in Row 3) and R3C2 cannot be 8 (distinct numbers). So R3C2 must be 9.
        If R3C2=9, then R3C4 = 20 - 9 = 11. This places 11 in Row 3, satisfying Clue 7.
        Row 3 becomes {8, 9, E, 11}. This is valid (8<9<11).
        Column 2 becomes {2, 6, 9, 10}. This is valid (2<6<9<10). This case is consistent.
    *   Case B: R3C1=E, R4C1=8.
        Row 3 is {E, R3C2, E, R3C4}. Sum: R3C2 + R3C4 = 28.
        Column 2 is {2, 6, R3C2, 10}. So, 6 < R3C2 < 10. Possible values for R3C2 are 7, 8, 9.
        Number 8 is used in R4C1, so R3C2 can be 7 or 9.
        If R3C2=7: R3C4 = 28 - 7 = 21 (Impossible, max number is 12).
        If R3C2=9: R3C4 = 28 - 9 = 19 (Impossible, max number is 12).
        Case B is not possible.
11. Therefore, Case A is the only valid configuration: R3C1=8, R4C1=E, R3C2=9, R3C4=11.
The number in (Row 3, Column 2) is 9."

    *   (R2,C1) = 5 (Clue 5).

    *   Clue 2 (numbers in a column increase T-B) means R2C1 < R3C1 (if R3C1 is filled). So 5 < R3C1.

2.  From Step 10 and 11 of Q1 solution, using Clue 9 (Sum of Row 3 = 28), it was uniquely determined that R3C1=8 and (Row 4, Column 1) is Empty (E).

Since R3C3 is E, R4C3 can be filled if a number is available. However, all 12 distinct numbers 1-12 are already placed. This means R4C3 must be the 4th empty slot.

Row 1: {1,2,3,4}
Row 2: {5,6,7,E}  --- (R2,C3) is 7.

Row 4: {E,10,E,12}
The empty slots are (R2,C4), (R3,C3), (R4,C1), (R4,C3).

The question posits a hypothetical scenario:
1.  The number in (R3,C4) changes from 11 to 10.
2.  The number 10 originally in (R4,C2) is removed, making (R4,C2) empty.
3.  The displaced number 11 (from R3,C4) must be placed in an available empty slot, maintaining all grid rules (L-R increase in rows, T-B increase in columns, 4 empty slots total).

Let's analyze the grid state after changes 1 and 2, before placing 11:
Row 1: {1,2,3,4} (Unchanged)
Row 2: {5,6,7,E} (Unchanged, (R2,C3) is still 7)
Row 3: {8,9,E,10} (R3C4 is now 10. Row still L-R increasing: 8<9<10)
Row 4: {E, E, E,12} (R4C2 is now E. R4C1 and R4C3 were already E)

The numbers currently on the grid are: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12. The number 11 is not on the grid.
The empty slots are:
-   Originally empty: (R2,C4), (R3,C3), (R4,C1), (R4,C3)
-   Newly empty: (R4,C2)
Total 5 empty slots. The number 11 must be placed in one of these, resulting in 4 empty slots.

We need to check where 11 can be placed, satisfying row/column increasing rules:
*   Can 11 go into (R2,C4)? Row 2 would be {5,6,7,11}. This is valid (7<11). Column 4 would be {4,11,10,12}. This is INVALID (11 is not < 10 in C4).
*   Can 11 go into (R3,C3)? Row 3 would be {8,9,11,10}. This is INVALID (11 is not < 10 in R3).
*   Can 11 go into (R4,C1)? Column 1 would be {1,5,8,11}. This is valid (8<11). Row 4 would be {11,E,E,12}. This is valid. If 11 is placed here, (R2,C3) is still 7.
*   Can 11 go into (R4,C3)? Row 4 would be {E,E,11,12}. This is valid (11<12). Column 3 would be {3,7,E,11}. This is valid (7<11). If 11 is placed here, (R2,C3) is still 7.
*   Can 11 go into (R4,C2)? Row 4 would be {E,11,E,12}. This is valid. Column 2 would be {2,6,9,11}. This is valid (9<11). If 11 is placed here, (R2,C3) is still 7.

In all valid possibilities for placing the number 11 ((R4,C1), (R4,C3), or (R4,C2)), the slot (R2,C3) is unaffected by the placement of 11, as it was not empty to begin with and not part of the direct modifications.

7.	Let's calculate Actual Man-Hours for P2 in Operations:

    *   P8 (C2, 90SH): O_Eff_C2 = 1.0. Actual_P8@O = 90 * 1.0 = 90.
9.	Test the two possibilities for F:
    *   Case 1: F takes P3 (C2).
        Then O must take P5 (C1) and P8 (C2).
        Actual_O = Actual_P2@O + Actual_P5@O + Actual_P8@O = 160 + 72 + 90 = 322. This matches Info 2.
        So, F = {P6, P3}. O = {P2, P5, P8}. M = {P1, P4, P7}. This is a valid assignment.
    *   Case 2: F takes P8 (C2).
        Then O must take P3 (C1) and P5 (C2).
        Actual_O = Actual_P2@O + Actual_P3@O + Actual_P5@O = 160 + 80 + 72 = 312. This does not match Info 2 (322).
