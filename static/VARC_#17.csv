Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VARC),40,VARC_Q1,1,RC_Passage1_Myths,"The discourse surrounding myth often consigns it to antiquity, viewing it as a collection of primitive narratives superseded by rational thought and scientific inquiry. However, this perspective overlooks the persistent and dynamic role of myth in shaping contemporary societies. Modern myths are not mere survivals of a bygone era; they are actively constructed, contested, and reconfigured to serve specific ideological, political, and cultural functions. They often operate insidiously, weaving themselves into the fabric of national identity, consumer culture, or political rhetoric, thereby naturalizing particular worldviews and power structures.

Unlike folklore, which may retain a more localized and traditional character, contemporary myths frequently achieve global reach, disseminated through mass media and digital platforms. These narratives, while sometimes drawing on ancient archetypes, are tailored to address modern anxieties, aspirations, and conflicts. The myth of the self-made individual, for instance, underpins much of neoliberal ideology, celebrating relentless ambition while often obscuring systemic inequalities. Similarly, nationalistic myths, often rooted in selective interpretations of history, galvanize collective sentiment but can also fuel xenophobia and exclusionary practices.

The power of modern myth lies in its capacity to offer seemingly coherent explanations for complex phenomena and to foster a sense of shared meaning or purpose, however illusory. These myths often function by simplifying reality, creating heroes and villains, and providing narratives of origin, destiny, or redemption. Critically engaging with these myths requires deconstructing their underlying assumptions, identifying the interests they serve, and recognizing their constructed nature.

Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VARC),40,VARC_Q5,5,RC_Passage2_Cosmos,"The cosmos, as we currently understand it, is predominantly composed of entities that remain stubbornly beyond our direct observational capacity: dark matter and dark energy. Together, these enigmatic components are believed to constitute approximately 95% of the total mass-energy content of the universe, with ordinary, visible matter comprising a mere 5%. The postulation of dark matter arose from discrepancies between the observed gravitational effects in galaxies and galaxy clusters—such as their rotational speeds and lensing of light—and the amount of luminous matter detectable. Essentially, galaxies spin faster than they should if only their visible components were contributing to their mass, implying the presence of additional, unseen mass providing the requisite gravitational pull.

Dark energy, an even more mysterious concept, was invoked to explain the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. In the late 1990s, observations of distant supernovae revealed that the universe's expansion is not slowing down due to gravity, as previously expected, but is instead speeding up. Dark energy is hypothesized to be a form of energy inherent to space itself, possessing a negative pressure that drives this cosmic acceleration, acting in opposition to gravity.

Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VARC),40,VARC_Q9,9,RC_Passage3_RegulatoryCapture,"Regulatory capture, a concept central to public choice theory, describes a phenomenon where regulatory agencies, ostensibly created to act in the public interest, come to be dominated by the very industries or special interests they are charged with regulating.

However, the pervasive influence of money in politics and the inherent information asymmetries between regulators and powerful industries mean that vigilance and continuous reform efforts are necessary to mitigate this enduring threat to effective governance.","According to the passage, the ""revolving door"" contributes to regulatory capture primarily by:","Ensuring that regulators have practical, hands-on experience within the industries they oversee.",Reducing the operational costs of regulatory agencies by hiring experienced industry professionals.,Creating potential conflicts of interest and incentives for regulators to favor industry due to future job prospects or past affiliations.,Facilitating the direct transfer of proprietary technology from industries to government agencies.,A,B,C,D,C,MCQ,RC,RC Passage Genre: Economics & Business,Medium,Supporting Idea / Detail Based,"question_id: Q11, section: VARC, question_type: MCQ, topic: RC, sub_topic: RC Passage Genre: Economics & Business, concept_tested: Supporting Idea / Detail Based, difficulty_level: Medium, is_tita: false, set_id: MockSet1_VARC, unique_mock_id: 381069257",false,MockSet1_VARC,Remembering,"Para 2 explains the ""revolving door"" creates ""incentives for regulators to favor industry interests in anticipation of future employment, or brings industry insiders with pre-existing biases into regulatory roles.""

Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VARC),40,VARC_Q12,12,RC_Passage3_RegulatoryCapture,"Regulatory capture, a concept central to public choice theory, describes a phenomenon where regulatory agencies, ostensibly created to act in the public interest, come to be dominated by the very industries or special interests they are charged with regulating. This co-optation does not always occur through overt corruption or bribery; often, it is a more subtle process, evolving through the cultivation of close relationships, the exchange of personnel via the ""revolving door"" between industry and government, and the industry's superior resources for lobbying and information provision. The consequence is that regulations may be designed and enforced in ways that benefit the regulated entities rather than protecting consumers, the environment, or broader societal welfare.

Several mechanisms facilitate regulatory capture. Industries possess concentrated interests and significant financial resources, enabling them to invest heavily in lobbying efforts, campaign contributions, and shaping public discourse. They can also fund research that supports their preferred policy outcomes, creating an ""epistemic capture"" where the very knowledge base informing regulation is skewed. Furthermore, regulators often rely on industry for technical expertise, which can lead to an over-reliance on industry perspectives. The ""revolving door""—where regulators leave their government positions for lucrative jobs in the industries they once oversaw, or vice versa—creates incentives for regulators to favor industry interests in anticipation of future employment, or brings industry insiders with pre-existing biases into regulatory roles.

The detrimental effects of regulatory capture are manifold. It can lead to weakened safety standards, environmental degradation, anti-competitive practices, financial instability (as seen in some analyses of financial crises), and a general erosion of public trust in government. Combating regulatory capture is challenging, requiring robust transparency measures, stringent ethics rules, independent funding for regulatory agencies, and mechanisms for greater public participation in the regulatory process.

Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VARC),40,VARC_Q13,13,RC_Passage4_InterpretiveTurn,"The ""interpretive turn"" in the social sciences, gaining prominence from the mid-20th century onwards, marked a significant epistemological shift away from the dominant positivist paradigms that had long sought to emulate the methods of the natural sciences. Positivism, with its emphasis on empirical observation, value-neutrality, and the discovery of universal laws governing social phenomena, was challenged by thinkers who argued that human social life is fundamentally different from the natural world. The core contention of interpretivism is that social reality is not an objective, external entity waiting to be discovered, but is instead actively constructed, maintained, and transformed through the meanings, symbols, and interpretations that individuals and groups assign to their actions and social contexts.

This shift necessitated a re-evaluation of methodological approaches. Rather than focusing solely on quantifiable data and causal explanation, interpretive social science prioritizes understanding (Verstehen) the subjective meanings, intentions, and cultural frameworks that inform human behavior. Qualitative methods such as ethnography, in-depth interviews, discourse analysis, and hermeneutics became central, as they allow researchers to delve into the rich, contextual, and often nuanced tapestry of social life. Proponents argue that by ignoring the interpretive dimensions of human experience, positivist approaches risk producing superficial or misleading accounts of social phenomena, mistaking statistical correlations for genuine understanding of human agency and cultural dynamics.

However, the interpretive turn has not been without its critics. Concerns have been raised about the potential for subjectivity and bias in research, the difficulty of generalizing findings from context-specific studies, and the perceived lack of rigor compared to quantitative methods. Some also argue that an excessive focus on micro-level interpretations can obscure the influence of larger structural forces, such as economic systems or political institutions, on individual lives and social patterns.
