Five multi-grain flour blends – B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5 – are analyzed for their nutrient composition. Each blend is made from a unique primary base grain: Wheat, Rice, Millet, Oat, or Corn. These base grains fall into broader categories: Cereals (Wheat, Rice, Corn), Millets (Millet), and Pseudo-cereals (Oat).
For each blend, the composition is given in grams per 100g of the blend for four nutrients: Carbohydrate (C), Protein (P), Fat (F), and Fiber (Fi). Thus, for each blend, C + P + F + Fi = 100. All nutrient values are integers.
The following table provides some information about the nutrient composition of these blends. Some values are missing and denoted by a '?'.
Table 1: Nutrient Composition (grams per 100g)

Additional Facts:
1.	For any blend based on a Cereal grain, its Carbohydrate content is higher than that of any blend based on a Millet grain.
2.	The blend based on a Pseudo-cereal grain has a Protein content that is higher than the Protein content of any blend based on a Cereal grain.
3.	For the Millet-based blend (B3), the Protein content is twice its Fat content.
4.	The Fiber content of blend B5 is 15g.
5.	The Carbohydrate content of blend B2 is 75g.","Consider a new blend B6, which is also Cereal-based. Its Protein content is 10g and Fat content is 3g. If its Carbohydrate content must be higher than that of B3, what is the maximum possible Fiber content for B6?",26,25,24,23,A,B,C,D,A,MCQ,Data Interpretation,"Tabular DI, Conditional Reasoning",Moderate,"sum to 100, hierarchical constraint, optimization","sum to 100, hierarchical constraint, optimization",False,MOCKCAT24S3GEN01_Set2_FlourBlends,Optimization,"For new blend B6: P = 10g, F = 3g. Since C + P + F + Fi = 100, we have C_B6 + 10 + 3 + Fi_B6 = 100, which simplifies to C_B6 + Fi_B6 = 87.
Fact 1 states Cereal-based blends have Carbohydrate content higher than Millet-based blends. B3 is Millet-based with C_B3 = 60g.
So, C_B6 > 60. Since all values are integers, the minimum possible value for C_B6 is 61g.
To maximize Fiber (Fi_B6), we must minimize Carbohydrate (C_B6).
Using the minimum C_B6 = 61g, we can find the maximum Fi_B6:
61 + Fi_B6 = 87.
Fi_B6 = 87 - 61 = 26g.
The maximum possible Fiber content is 26g."

From the mode analysis, the AC was in Eco Mode during the intervals starting at 5:00 PM and 5:30 PM.
If Eco Mode power is changed to 0.7 kW:
- Total power at 5:00 PM = New Eco AC power + Base Load = 0.7 kW + 0.2 kW = 0.9 kW.
- Total power at 5:30 PM = New Eco AC power + Base Load = 0.7 kW + 0.2 kW = 0.9 kW.
The sum of these two rates is 0.9 kW + 0.9 kW = 1.8 kW."
