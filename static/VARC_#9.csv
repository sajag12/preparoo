VARC,40,ABCDEF123_Q1,1,P1_Algorithms,"The encroachment of algorithmic decision-making into ever more domains of human life presents a complex ethical tapestry. While algorithms promise efficiency and objectivity, their design and deployment are often opaque, leading to concerns about accountability and bias. The notion of ""algorithmic bias"" itself is multifaceted; it can stem from skewed datasets that reflect historical prejudices, or it can be embedded in the very architecture of the algorithm – the choice of variables, the definition of success, and the trade-offs made between competing objectives. For instance, an algorithm designed to predict recidivism, if trained predominantly on data from over-policed communities, may perpetuate a cycle of disadvantage, even if the algorithm itself is mathematically ""neutral"" in its processing of given inputs.
Beyond data-driven biases, a more insidious challenge lies in the ""objective functions"" that algorithms are programmed to optimize. An algorithm designed to maximize user engagement on a social media platform might inadvertently promote sensational or divisive content, as these often elicit strong reactions. Here, the ethical lapse is not in the data, but in the goal itself, which may not align with broader societal well-being, such as fostering informed public discourse or mental health. This points to a fundamental question: who defines these objectives, and by what ethical framework are they guided? The pursuit of narrowly defined efficiency or profit, when automated and scaled, can have far-reaching and often unforeseen societal consequences.
The black box nature of many advanced algorithms, particularly in deep learning, further complicates ethical oversight. When an algorithm denies a loan application or flags an individual for surveillance, the inability to receive a clear, human-understandable explanation for the decision can be deeply problematic. This lack of transparency undermines trust and makes it difficult to contest or rectify errors. Moreover, the very act of translating complex social phenomena into quantifiable metrics suitable for algorithmic processing can lead to a reductionist view of human experience, where unquantifiable values like empathy, context, or individual circumstance are marginalized.
Addressing these challenges requires a multi-pronged approach. It involves not only technical solutions like fairness-aware machine learning and a greater emphasis on data representativeness but also robust ethical guidelines, interdisciplinary collaboration in algorithm design, and mechanisms for public accountability. The allure of algorithmic efficiency must be tempered with a profound understanding of its potential to amplify existing inequalities and introduce new forms of harm. The goal should not be to halt technological progress, but to steer it in a direction that aligns with human values and democratic principles, ensuring that these powerful tools serve, rather than subvert, the common good.",Which of the following best expresses the main argument of the passage?,"Algorithmic bias is primarily a result of skewed datasets, which can be corrected with better data collection practices.","The primary ethical challenge of algorithms lies in their ""black box"" nature, making it impossible to understand their decision-making processes.","Algorithmic decision-making, while offering efficiency, poses significant ethical challenges due to embedded biases, misaligned objectives, and lack of transparency, requiring a comprehensive approach to ensure they serve human values.","Advanced algorithms, especially in deep learning, are inherently unethical because they reduce complex human experiences to quantifiable metrics.",1,2,3,4,3,MCQ,RC,RC Passage Genre: Science & Technology,Medium,Main Idea / Central Theme / Primary Purpose,"Algorithms, Ethics, Algorithmic Bias, Transparency, Accountability",False,MockSet1_VARC,Analysis,"The passage introduces algorithms and their ethical challenges.

Option 2, while a positive step, doesn't inherently invalidate the author's concerns about the fundamental nature of algorithmic bias or the difficulty of defining ethical objectives. Review boards are a procedural response, not a solution to the inherent technical/conceptual challenges.
Option 3 (increased public trust despite lack of transparency) doesn't weaken the author's argument about the existence of ethical problems or the need for transparency from a normative standpoint.

VARC,40,ABCDEF123_Q5,5,P2_DeepSea,"The deep sea, an environment extending from below the reach of sunlight to the abyssal plains, remains one of Earth's least explored frontiers. It is a realm of perpetual darkness, crushing pressures, and frigid temperatures, yet it teems with a surprising diversity of life, much of which has evolved unique adaptations to survive these extreme conditions. Bioluminescence, for instance, is a common phenomenon, used for communication, predation, and camouflage in the inky blackness. Organisms in the deep sea often exhibit gigantism or dwarfism compared to their shallow-water relatives, a response to the scarce food resources and unique ecological pressures.
Historically, the study of deep-sea ecosystems has been hampered by technological limitations. Early explorations relied on rudimentary dredges and nets, providing only fleeting glimpses of the life below. The advent of submersibles, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has revolutionized our ability to access and study these remote environments. These technologies allow for direct observation, sample collection, and in-situ experiments, yielding invaluable data on the biodiversity, geology, and chemical processes of the deep ocean. However, even with these advancements, a vast majority of the deep sea remains unmapped and unobserved, a veritable terra incognita.
The growing human footprint is now extending into these once-pristine depths. The prospect of deep-sea mining for valuable minerals like polymetallic nodules, cobalt-rich crusts, and seafloor massive sulphides raises significant environmental concerns. These mining activities could cause irreversible damage to fragile ecosystems, destroying habitats that have taken millennia to form and releasing plumes of sediment that could smother benthic communities over vast areas. The unique geochemistry of hydrothermal vents, which support chemosynthetic ecosystems independent of sunlight, is particularly vulnerable. These oases of life, hosting species found nowhere else on Earth, could be obliterated before their full biodiversity and ecological significance are understood.
Furthermore, the deep sea plays a crucial role in global biogeochemical cycles, including carbon sequestration. The ""biological pump"" transports organic carbon from the surface waters to the deep ocean, where it can be stored for centuries, mitigating climate change. Disturbances to deep-sea ecosystems, whether from mining, oil and gas exploration, or bottom trawling, could disrupt these critical processes, with potentially far-reaching consequences for the global climate system. Effective conservation and management strategies are therefore imperative. This requires a precautionary approach, grounded in robust scientific understanding, international cooperation, and a recognition of the intrinsic value of these unique and vulnerable ecosystems, before irreversible damage is done to this final frontier.

VARC,40,ABCDEF123_Q9,9,P3_BigTechRegulation,"The regulation of global digital platforms, often referred to as ""Big Tech,"" presents one of the most formidable policy challenges of our time. These entities, straddling national borders and wielding immense economic and informational power, operate within a complex and often ill-defined legal and ethical landscape. The traditional tools of national regulation, designed for brick-and-mortar industries or territorially bounded services, frequently prove inadequate when applied to the borderless, rapidly evolving digital realm.
One of the core difficulties lies in jurisdiction. A platform headquartered in one country may provide services to users in hundreds of others, each with its own set of laws regarding data privacy, content moderation, competition, and taxation. Enforcing national laws against a global entity that can easily shift data and operations across borders is a Sisyphean task. This has led to calls for greater international cooperation and the development of supranational regulatory frameworks, but achieving consensus among diverse nations with often competing economic and political interests is itself a monumental challenge. The very architecture of the internet, designed for resilience and decentralization, can be leveraged by these platforms to resist localized regulatory pressures.
Another significant issue is the concentration of market power. Many digital markets are characterized by ""winner-takes-all"" dynamics, where network effects and data advantages lead to the dominance of a few large players. This can stifle innovation, limit consumer choice, and create an uneven playing field for smaller businesses. Antitrust authorities globally are grappling with how to apply traditional competition law, which often focuses on consumer prices, to platforms that offer services ""for free"" (in exchange for data) or operate in multi-sided markets. Defining relevant markets and assessing market power in this context requires new analytical tools and a willingness to look beyond conventional metrics.
Data governance is a further area of intense debate. The vast quantities of personal data collected by these platforms are the lifeblood of their business models, fueling targeted advertising and the development of AI-driven services. However, concerns about surveillance, a lack of transparency in data use, and the potential for manipulation are widespread.

VARC,40,ABCDEF123_Q10,10,P3_BigTechRegulation,"The regulation of global digital platforms, often referred to as ""Big Tech,"" presents one of the most formidable policy challenges of our time. These entities, straddling national borders and wielding immense economic and informational power, operate within a complex and often ill-defined legal and ethical landscape. The traditional tools of national regulation, designed for brick-and-mortar industries or territorially bounded services, frequently prove inadequate when applied to the borderless, rapidly evolving digital realm.
One of the core difficulties lies in jurisdiction. A platform headquartered in one country may provide services to users in hundreds of others, each with its own set of laws regarding data privacy, content moderation, competition, and taxation. Enforcing national laws against a global entity that can easily shift data and operations across borders is a Sisyphean task. This has led to calls for greater international cooperation and the development of supranational regulatory frameworks, but achieving consensus among diverse nations with often competing economic and political interests is itself a monumental challenge. The very architecture of the internet, designed for resilience and decentralization, can be leveraged by these platforms to resist localized regulatory pressures.
Another significant issue is the concentration of market power. Many digital markets are characterized by ""winner-takes-all"" dynamics, where network effects and data advantages lead to the dominance of a few large players. This can stifle innovation, limit consumer choice, and create an uneven playing field for smaller businesses. Antitrust authorities globally are grappling with how to apply traditional competition law, which often focuses on consumer prices, to platforms that offer services ""for free"" (in exchange for data) or operate in multi-sided markets.

VARC,40,ABCDEF123_Q13,13,P4_Nostalgia,"Nostalgia, a sentimental longing or wistful affection for a period in the past, is a complex and increasingly pervasive phenomenon in contemporary culture. Far from being a simple, saccharine yearning for ""the good old days,"" nostalgia serves a variety of psychological and social functions. It can be a source of comfort in times of uncertainty, a way of maintaining a sense of identity and continuity, and a collective mechanism for coping with rapid societal change. However, its embrace is not without its critics, who point to its potential to idealize the past, obscure historical complexities, and even hinder progress by fostering a regressive orientation.
Psychologically, nostalgia often arises during periods of transition or perceived discontinuity in an individual's life. It can act as an emotional anchor, providing a sense of stability by connecting one's present self to a cherished past. Studies have shown that nostalgic reverie can increase positive mood, boost self-esteem, and enhance feelings of social connectedness. This is partly because the memories typically evoked by nostalgia are often filtered through a positive lens, emphasizing warmth, security, and belonging, while downplaying or forgetting negative aspects of the past. This selective recall is a key feature of what is often termed ""personal nostalgia.""
Beyond the individual, ""collective nostalgia"" plays a significant role in shaping cultural narratives and group identities. This can manifest in a society's fondness for particular historical eras, cultural artifacts, or even idealized versions of national character. Such collective reminiscence can foster social cohesion and a shared sense of heritage. However, it can also be politically potent, leveraged to promote particular ideologies or to resist contemporary social changes. The selective and often romanticized portrayal of a nation's past, for example, can be used to legitimize current power structures or to create an ""us versus them"" mentality against perceived outside influences.
The commodification of nostalgia is another prominent feature of modern life. From retro fashion and vintage-inspired designs to reboots of old movies and television shows, the market readily capitalizes on our longing for the past. While this can provide a sense of familiarity and pleasure, it also risks trivializing or decontextualizing historical experience.

What you have to be able to do is to build without knowing where you're going because you've never been there before. That's what creativity is - you have to be allowed to build. And a lot of comedians now are sitting there and when they think of something, they say something like, 'Can I get away with it? I don't think so.

The sentence before blank (3) details the puzzle: hens peck mica, but it's not found in their gizzards. The sentence to be placed, ""Yet each day the flock produced eggs with calcareous shells though they apparently had not ingested any calcium from land which was entirely lacking in limestone,"" adds another layer to this puzzle: the hens are producing calcium-rich eggshells despite no obvious calcium intake and while consuming mica. This deepens the mystery that Kervran is trying to solve. The sentence after blank (3), ""It took Kervran many years to establish that the chickens were transmuting one element into another,"" then presents the resolution to this compounded puzzle (mica consumption + eggshell production without dietary calcium). So, the inserted sentence fits perfectly at (3) as the final piece of the puzzle before the solution is revealed.
Placing it at (1) or (2) would disrupt the introduction of the mica-pecking observation and Kervran's initial confusion about it. Placing it at (4) would be after the solution (transmutation) is already stated, making it redundant or out of logical order."

2. Though ""algorithmic bias"" is the popular term, the foundation of such bias is not in algorithms, but in the data; algorithms are not biased, data is, as algorithms merely reflect persistent patterns that are present in the training data.
3. Despite their widespread impact, it is relatively easier to fix AI biases than human-generated biases, as it is simpler to identify the former than to try to make people unlearn behaviors learnt over generations.
4. The impact of biased decisions made by humans is localised and geographically confined, but with the advent of AI, the impact of such decisions is spread over a much wider scale.","The four sentences (labelled 1, 2, 3 and 4) below, when properly sequenced, would yield a coherent paragraph.

VARC,40,ABCDEF123_Q22,22,VA_PS_Idleness,"People view idleness as a sin and industriousness as a virtue, and in the process have developed an unsatisfactory relationship with their jobs. Work has become a way for them to keep busy, even though many find their work meaningless. In their need for activity people undertake what was once considered work (fishing, gardening) as hobbies. The opposing view is that hard work has made us prosperous and improved our levels of health and education. It has also brought innovation and labour and time-saving devices, which have lessened life’s drudgery.",The passage given below is followed by four alternate summaries.

The first part describes the negative view: idleness is seen as a sin, work as a virtue, leading to meaningless jobs and hobbies replacing what was once work. The second part presents the opposing (positive) view: hard work has led to prosperity, improved health/education, innovation, and reduced drudgery. Option 1 best captures this duality by acknowledging both the ""meaningless jobs and endless activity"" (negative aspect) and the ""tremendous social benefits from prosperity and innovation"" (positive aspect) stemming from the idealisation of hard work.
Option 2 mentions ""greater idleness"" as a result of glorifying hard work, which isn't the focus of the negative view presented (it's more about meaningless activity).
Option 3 introduces the idea of reserving leisure time, which is a prescriptive statement not directly reflecting the descriptive summary of the two views in the paragraph.
Option 4 only focuses on the positive aspects of hard work and mentions ""detractors,"" but the paragraph presents the first view as a significant perspective on how work is viewed, not just as a detractor's point."
VARC,40,ABCDEF123_Q23,23,VA_SP_Kissing,"Research has hypothesised that the earliest evidence of human lip kissing originated in a very specific geographical location in South Asia 3,500 years ago.(1). From there it may have spread to other regions, simultaneously accelerating the spread of the herpes simplex virus 1. According to Dr Troels Pank Arbøll and Dr Sophie Lund Rasmussen, who in a new article in the journal Science draw on a range of written sources from the earliest Mesopotamian societies, kissing was already a well-established practice 4,500 years ago in the Middle East.(2). In ancient Mesopotamia, people wrote in cuneiform script on clay tablets.(3). Many thousands of these clay tablets have survived to this day, and they contain clear examples that kissing was considered a part of romantic intimacy in ancient times.(4). “Kissing could also have been part of friendships and family members' relations,"" says Dr Troels Pank Arbøll, an expert on the history of medicine in Mesopotamia.","There is a sentence that is missing in the paragraph below.

The sentence before blank (2) introduces the Mesopotamian evidence of kissing 4,500 years ago. The sentence to be placed, ""And probably much earlier, moving the documentation for kissing back 1,000 years compared to what was acknowledged in the scientific community,"" logically follows this. The ""4,500 years ago"" directly supports pushing documentation back 1,000 years from the previously mentioned ""3,500 years ago"" South Asian hypothesis. The phrase ""And probably much earlier"" also suggests that the 4,500 years itself might not be the absolute earliest. The sentence after blank (2), ""In ancient Mesopotamia, people wrote in cuneiform script on clay tablets,"" then begins to elaborate on the *source* of this Mesopotamian evidence.
Placing it at (1) would be premature as it refers to moving documentation back based on evidence not yet presented.
Placing it at (3) or (4) would disrupt the flow of explaining the cuneiform evidence."
