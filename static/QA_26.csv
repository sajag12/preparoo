In the first scenario, a delay of 45 minutes occurs. In the second, the snag is 30 km further, and the delay is 36 minutes.
The reduction in delay (45 - 36 = 9 minutes) is because the 30 km segment was covered at the usual speed S instead of the reduced speed (4/5)S.

10 can be factored as 10 or 5 × 2.
This implies N must be of the form p⁹ or p⁴q¹.
N is a multiple of 8 (2³).
Case 1: N = p⁹.
If p=2, N = 2⁹ = 512. This is a multiple of 2³.
If p is any other prime, N is odd and not a multiple of 8.
Candidate from this case: 512.
Case 2: N = p⁴q¹.
Since N is a multiple of 2³, one of the primes must be 2.
Subcase 2.1: p = 2. N = 2⁴q¹ = 16q. This is always a multiple of 8. To make N the smallest, we choose the smallest prime q ≠ 2, so q=3. N = 16 * 3 = 48.
Subcase 2.2: q = 2. N = p⁴ * 2¹. For N to be a multiple of 8, p⁴ must be a multiple of 4. As p is a prime ≠ 2, p is odd, so p⁴ is odd and cannot be a multiple of 4. No solution here.

Using Euler's totient theorem: φ(45) = φ(3² * 5) = φ(3²) * φ(5) = (3² - 3¹) * (5¹ - 5⁰) = 6 * 4 = 24.
Since gcd(7, 45) = 1, by Euler's theorem, 7²⁴ ≡ 1 (mod 45).
We can write 100 in terms of 24: 100 = 4 × 24 + 4.
Therefore, 7¹⁰⁰ = 7^(4×24 + 4) = (7²⁴)⁴ × 7⁴.
In modulo 45, this becomes:
7¹⁰⁰ ≡ (1)⁴ × 7⁴ (mod 45)
7¹⁰⁰ ≡ 7⁴ (mod 45).

Domain constraints require x > 1.
Use the change of base formula on the right side: log₁₆(A) = log₄(A) / log₄(16) = log₄(A) / 2.
The equation becomes:
log₄(log₂(x)) = (1/2) * log₄(log₄(x))
Using the log property n*log(a) = log(aⁿ):
log₄(log₂(x)) = log₄((log₄(x))^(1/2))
Equating the arguments:
log₂(x) = (log₄(x))^(1/2)
Square both sides:
(log₂(x))² = log₄(x)
Apply change of base again: log₄(x) = log₂(x)/log₂(4) = log₂(x)/2.
So, (log₂(x))² = log₂(x)/2.
Let y = log₂(x). The equation is y² = y/2.
2y² - y = 0 => y(2y - 1) = 0.
This gives y = 0 or y = 1/2.
If y = 0, log₂(x) = 0 => x = 1, which violates the domain constraint.

In how many ways can this be done if the committee must have at least 2 boys and at least 2 girls, and a particular boy B1 refuses to be on the committee if a particular girl G1 is also a member?",TITA,Q87,QA,40,MockSet1_QA,"Total: 6 Boys, 4 Girls. Committee of 5.
Conditions: At least 2 boys, at least 2 girls.
Possible compositions (Boys, Girls): (3B, 2G) or (2B, 3G).
Condition: Boy B1 and Girl G1 cannot be together. We calculate total cases for each composition and subtract the cases where B1 and G1 are together.
Case 1: 3 Boys, 2 Girls
Total ways = C(6,3) * C(4,2) = 20 * 6 = 120.
Ways with B1 and G1 together: Select B1 and G1. Need 2 more boys from remaining 5 (C(5,2)=10) and 1 more girl from remaining 3 (C(3,1)=3). Ways = 10 * 3 = 30.
Valid ways for (3B, 2G) = 120 - 30 = 90.
Case 2: 2 Boys, 3 Girls
Total ways = C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15 * 4 = 60.
Ways with B1 and G1 together: Select B1 and G1. Need 1 more boy from remaining 5 (C(5,1)=5) and 2 more girls from remaining 3 (C(3,2)=3). Ways = 5 * 3 = 15.
Valid ways for (2B, 3G) = 60 - 15 = 45.
Total valid ways = 90 + 45 = 135.

Three balls are drawn one by one without replacement. What is the probability that the balls drawn are alternately of different colors (e.g., RBR or BRB)?",MCQ,Q88,QA,40,MockSet1_QA,"Total balls = 5 Red (R) + 7 Blue (B) = 12 balls.
Three balls are drawn one by one without replacement.
The required sequences are RBR or BRB.
Probability of RBR = P(1st R) * P(2nd B) * P(3rd R)
= (5/12) * (7/11) * (4/10) = 140 / 1320.
Probability of BRB = P(1st B) * P(2nd R) * P(3rd B)
= (7/12) * (5/11) * (6/10) = 210 / 1320.
Total probability = P(RBR) + P(BRB) = (140 + 210) / 1320 = 350 / 1320.
Simplify the fraction: 350 / 1320 = 35 / 132.
The correct option is (1).",Probability,Modern Maths
