The OCI, on a 0-100 scale, reflects a nation's overall engagement in international scientific collaboration. Each nation's OCI is a sum of its collaboration efforts across four primary fields: Quantum Physics (QP), Bio-Engineering (BE), AI & Robotics (AR), and Sustainable Energy (SE). The contribution of each field is expressed as a percentage of that nation's OCI for that year, and these percentages sum to 100% for each nation in each assessment year. OCI values are always integers.
Collaboration Intensity Bands are defined as: Low (OCI 0-25), Medium (OCI 26-50), High (OCI 51-75), Very High (OCI 76-100).

"Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation","","CATMOCKDLR001_Q19","19","CATMOCKDLR001_Set5_ArtefactDating","An archaeology team is analyzing five ancient artefacts (A1, A2, A3, A4, A5) discovered at a single excavation site. Each artefact is believed to have originated from one of four possible ancient civilizations (C1: Indus Valley, C2: Mesopotamian, C3: Egyptian, C4: Minoan) and belongs to one of three distinct historical periods (P1: Early Bronze Age, P2: Middle Bronze Age, P3: Late Bronze Age). Each artefact has a unique combination of Civilization and Period. The team uses two primary dating techniques: Carbon Dating (CD) which gives a year range, and Thermoluminescence (TL) which gives a specific estimated year. An artefact's ""Confidence Score"" (CS) for its assigned period is derived from how well the CD range and TL year align with established period timelines.
Established Period Timelines:
•	P1 (Early Bronze Age): 3300 BCE – 2000 BCE (inclusive of 2000 BCE)
•	P2 (Middle Bronze Age): 2000 BCE – 1600 BCE (exclusive of 2000 BCE, inclusive of 1600 BCE)
•	P3 (Late Bronze Age): 1600 BCE – 1200 BCE (exclusive of 1600 BCE, inclusive of 1200 BCE)
Artefact Dating Data & Confidence Score Rules:
•	An artefact is assigned to Period Px if its TL date falls strictly within Px's start and end years (or is equal to the end year if Px is P1, P2, P3; or equal to start year if Px is P1) AND its CD range has a ""substantial overlap"" with Px.
•	""Substantial overlap"" means at least 50% (i.e., >= 50%) of the CD range's length falls within the years of Period Px.
•	Confidence Score (CS) = (Overlap_Years_CD_with_Assigned_Period / Length_of_CD_Range) * 100. CS is rounded to the nearest integer. If the conditions for assignment to any period are not met, the artefact is ""Unclassified"" for period and CS=0.

3.	The TL Date for A4 is 1400 BCE.
4.	The actual properties and data of Artefact A1 (Civilization C1, CD Range 3100-2050 BCE, TL Date 2100 BCE) resulted in it being definitively assigned to Period P1 for the purpose of uniqueness checks with other artefacts.

Clue 4 states A1 was definitively assigned to Period P1.
Period P1 is [3300 BCE, 2000 BCE] (i.e., dates X such that X <= 3300 BCE and X >= 2000 BCE). The TL Date 2100 BCE falls within P1.
The CD Range [3100 BCE, 2050 BCE] (i.e., dates Y such that Y <= 3100 BCE and Y >= 2050 BCE) is entirely contained within P1 (as 3300 >= 3100 and 2050 >= 2000).
Thus, the Overlap Length is equal to the CD Range Length, which is 1050 years.
The substantial overlap condition (Overlap Length / CD Range Length >= 0.5) is met: 1050 / 1050 = 1.0 >= 0.5.
