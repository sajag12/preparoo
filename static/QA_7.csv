QA,40,Q155,1,,,"The cost of a specialty metal alloy when in spherical form varies directly as the cube of its radius. A spherical bead of this alloy with radius 'r' costs Rs. 12,000. A coin is to be made from this alloy with radius '1.5r' and thickness '0.8t', where 't' is a standard thickness unit. The cost of the alloy when in coin form varies directly as the square of its coin-radius and directly as its coin-thickness. If 10% of the coin's material by volume is an impurity (costing negligible), what is the effective cost of the valuable alloy material in this specific coin, assuming the constant of variation for cost per unit (radius² × thickness) for the coin is the same as the constant of variation for cost per unit (radius³) for the sphere when the standard thickness unit 't' is equal to the sphere's radius 'r'?","Rs. 21,870","Rs. 24,300","Rs. 19,440","Rs. 29,160",A,B,C,D,C,MCQ,Arithmetic,"Ratio, Proportion & Variation",Hard,"Joint Variation, Cost Calculation, Percentage Impurity","Joint Variation, Cost Calculation, Percentage Impurity, Volume interpretation",False,MockSet_CAT_Final_CleanV4,Analyzing,"Let the constant of variation be K.
For a sphere, Cost = K * (radius)³. For Coin A (sphere): 12,000 = K * r³. So, K = 12000/r³.
For a coin, Cost = K_coin * (radius_coin)² * (thickness_coin).
The problem states ""assuming the constant of variation... for the coin is the same as ... for the sphere when t=r"". This implies if we consider a hypothetical coin with radius 'r' and thickness 'r', its cost factor (r² * r = r³) would use the same K as the sphere. So K_coin = K.
Coin B: radius_coin = 1.5r, thickness_coin = 0.8r (since t=r for establishing K's value context).
Cost of Coin B (if pure material) = K * (1.5r)² * (0.8r)
= (12000/r³) * (2.25r²) * (0.8r) = (12000/r³) * (1.8r³) = 12000 * 1.8 = Rs. 21,600.
10% of Coin B's material is impurity, so 90% is valuable material.
Effective cost of valuable material in Coin B = 0.90 * Cost_B_pure
= 0.90 * 21600 = Rs. 19,440.
The correct option is (C)."

(x-2) is a factor => P(2)=0: 16 + 8a + 4b - 40 + 24 = 0 => 8a + 4b = 0 => 2a + b = 0 (1).
P(-1)=30: 1 - a + b + 20 + 24 = 30 => -a + b + 45 = 30 => -a + b = -15 (2).

1.	x² - 4x - 1 > 4
x² - 4x - 5 > 0
(x-5)(x+1) > 0
This holds when x < -1 or x > 5.
2.	x² - 4x - 1 < -4
x² - 4x + 3 < 0
(x-1)(x-3) < 0
This holds when 1 < x < 3.
The solution set is the union of the solutions from Case 1 and Case 2:
(-∞, -1) ∪ (1, 3) ∪ (5, ∞).
The correct option is (A)."

In how many years will it become 5 times itself at a rate of interest that is 50% higher than the original rate?,12 years,15 years,16 years,18 years,A,B,C,D,C,MCQ,Arithmetic,Simple Interest,Medium,"Simple Interest Time Calculation, Rate Change","SI N-tupling time, Rate Change",False,MockSet_CAT_Final_CleanV4,Applying,"Let Principal = P. Sum doubles (Amount = 2P) in 6 years at SI.
SI earned = 2P - P = P.
Using SI = (P×R×T)/100:
P = (P × R × 6) / 100 => 1 = 6R/100 => R = 100/6 = 50/3 %.
New rate R' = R + 50% of R = R × (1 + 0.50) = R × 1.5.
R' = (50/3) × (3/2) = 25%.
We want sum to become 5 times (Amount = 5P).
New SI = 5P - P = 4P.
Let new time be T'.
4P = (P × R' × T') / 100.
4P = (P × 25 × T') / 100.
4 = (25 T') / 100.
4 = T' / 4.
T' = 16 years.
The correct option is (C)."

Find the value of the 5th term of this sequence.,,,,,,,,,117,TITA,Algebra,"Sequences & Series (AP, GP, HP, Special Series)",Medium,Finding nth term from Sum of n terms,"Sum of n terms given as polynomial (non-quadratic), Finding nth term (Tn=Sn-Sn-1)",True,MockSet_CAT_Final_CleanV4,Applying,"S_n = 2n³ - n² + 4n.
The nth term T_n = S_n - S_(n-1) for n > 1.
We need T₅.
S₅ = 2(5³) - (5)² + 4(5) = 2(125) - 25 + 20 = 250 - 25 + 20 = 245.
S₄ = 2(4³) - (4)² + 4(4) = 2(64) - 16 + 16 = 128.
T₅ = S₅ - S₄ = 245 - 128 = 117.

QA,40,Q174,20,,,"A regular pyramid has a square base of side length 10 cm. Its slant height (the altitude of its triangular faces) is 13 cm. This pyramid is cut by a plane parallel to its base, midway between the base and the apex (i.e., the height of the frustum is half the height of the original pyramid). What is the total surface area of the frustum formed?",320 cm²,330 cm²,360 cm²,390 cm²,A,B,C,D,A,MCQ,Geometry,"Mensuration - 3D (Volume & Surface Area: Cubes, Cuboids, Cylinders, Cones, Spheres, Prisms, Pyramids, Frustum)",Hard,"Frustum of a Pyramid, Total Surface Area, Similar Solids","Frustum of a Pyramid, Total Surface Area, Similar Solids, Properties of Regular Pyramid",False,MockSet_CAT_Final_CleanV4,Analyzing,"Regular pyramid with square base: side a = 10 cm. Slant height L = 13 cm.
Height of pyramid H = √(L² - (a/2)²) = √(13² - 5²) = √(169 - 25) = √144 = 12 cm.
The pyramid is cut midway, so height of small removed pyramid h_s = H/2 = 12/2 = 6 cm.
By similarity, side of base of small pyramid a_s = a/2 = 10/2 = 5 cm.
Slant height of small pyramid L_s = L/2 = 13/2 = 6.5 cm.
TSA of frustum = Area(Bottom Base) + Area(Top Base) + LSA(Frustum).
Area(Bottom Base) = a² = 10² = 100 cm².
Area(Top Base) = a_s² = 5² = 25 cm².
LSA(Frustum) = LSA(Big Pyramid) - LSA(Small Pyramid).
LSA(Big Pyramid) = (1/2) × Perimeter of Base × Slant Height L = (1/2) × (4 × 10) × 13 = 20 × 13 = 260 cm².
LSA(Small Pyramid) = (1/2) × Perimeter of Base × Slant Height L_s = (1/2) × (4 × 5) × 6.5 = 10 × 6.5 = 65 cm².
LSA(Frustum) = 260 - 65 = 195 cm².
TSA(Frustum) = 100 + 25 + 195 = 320 cm².

Speed of Boat B in still water S_B = 10 km/hr.
Speed of stream S_S = 5 km/hr.
Both boats move downstream.
Effective downstream speed of A = S_A + S_S = 15 + 5 = 20 km/hr.
Effective downstream speed of B = S_B + S_S = 10 + 5 = 15 km/hr.
Boat A starts at P. Boat B starts at Q, 60 km downstream from P.
Since Boat A is faster than Boat B (20 km/hr > 15 km/hr), A will eventually overtake B.
Relative speed of A with respect to B = Speed_A_downstream - Speed_B_downstream
= 20 - 15 = 5 km/hr.
Initial distance between A and B = 60 km.
Time to overtake = Initial Distance / Relative Speed = 60 km / 5 km/hr = 12 hours.

Condition 1: Each child gets at least one: x₁ + x₂ + x₃ + x₄ = 10, where xᵢ ≥ 1.
Let yᵢ = xᵢ - 1, so yᵢ ≥ 0.
(y₁+1) + (y₂+1) + (y₃+1) + (y₄+1) = 10 => y₁ + y₂ + y₃ + y₄ = 6.
Number of non-negative solutions = C(N'+k-1, k-1) = C(6+4-1, 4-1) = C(9,3).
C(9,3) = (9×8×7)/(3×2×1) = 3×4×7 = 84.
Condition 2: No child gets more than 4 chocolates: xᵢ ≤ 4. This means yᵢ ≤ 3.
We use inclusion-exclusion. Total ways (with xᵢ≥1) is 84.
Subtract cases where at least one child gets > 4 (i.e., xᵢ ≥ 5, so yᵢ ≥ 4).
Let child 1 get at least 5: y₁ ≥ 4. Let y₁ = y'₁ + 4.
(y'₁+4) + y₂ + y₃ + y₄ = 6 => y'₁ + y₂ + y₃ + y₄ = 2.
Number of solutions for this = C(2+4-1, 4-1) = C(5,3) = 10.
There are C(4,1) = 4 ways to choose which child gets at least 5. So, 4 × 10 = 40 cases to subtract.
Can two children get at least 5? x₁≥5, x₂≥5. Then x₁+x₂≥10. Since x₃≥1, x₄≥1, sum x₁+x₂+x₃+x₄ ≥ 10+1+1 = 12. But sum is 10. So, two children cannot simultaneously get ≥ 5 chocolates.
So, number of ways = Total ways (xᵢ≥1) - Ways where (at least one xᵢ≥5).
= 84 - 40 = 44.
Answer: 44."
