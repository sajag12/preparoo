VARC,40,8A3B5C7D1_Q1,1,RC_Passage_1_Anthropology,"The concept of ""performance"" within anthropological studies has undergone a significant metamorphosis over the past few decades. Traditionally, anthropological attention to performance was largely confined to overtly ritualistic, ceremonial, or theatrical contexts – events marked as separate from the mundane fabric of daily life. These were often seen as stylized enactments that reinforced social structures, transmitted cultural knowledge, or mediated relationships with the supernatural. While this focus yielded invaluable insights into the symbolic systems and communal functions of such distinct performative genres, it inadvertently created a dichotomy between ""performance"" as a special, bounded event and ""everyday life"" as an unscripted, unreflexive domain.

However, influenced by thinkers like Erving Goffman, who explored the dramaturgical aspects of ordinary social interaction, and Victor Turner, whose later work expanded the notion of ""social drama"" beyond ritual, contemporary anthropology increasingly recognizes that performance is not merely an adjunct to social life but is constitutive of it. This newer perspective emphasizes ""performativity"" – the idea that social realities, including identities, roles, and even power relations, are actively and continuously constructed through repeated, stylized bodily acts and utterances. Thus, the seemingly trivial interactions of daily life – a particular way of speaking, gesturing, or dressing – become sites of performance, where individuals negotiate, assert, and sometimes subvert social norms and identities.

This expanded understanding does not negate the importance of studying formal performances; rather, it situates them within a broader continuum of performative practices. It allows anthropologists to ask, for instance, how the codes and conventions of a formal ritual might bleed into or be subtly referenced in everyday comportment, or conversely, how everyday performative styles might be amplified or transformed in a ceremonial setting. Furthermore, this approach highlights the agency of individuals. While social structures and cultural scripts provide a framework, they are not deterministic. Individuals interpret, appropriate, and often creatively manipulate these scripts in their daily performances, leading to both the reproduction and potential transformation of social order.

The methodological challenge for anthropologists, then, is to develop ethnographic sensitivities capable of capturing these more pervasive, often subtle, forms of performativity. It requires moving beyond the observation of demarcated ""events"" to an attentiveness towards the nuanced ways in which social actors continuously ""do"" their social worlds into being. This involves a focus on embodiment, discourse, and the contextual interpretation of actions that might otherwise appear insignificant.

VARC,40,8A3B5C7D1_Q5,5,RC_Passage_2_AAI,"Atmospheric aerosol injection (AAI), a form of solar geoengineering, proposes to cool the planet by reflecting a small percentage of incoming sunlight back to space, mimicking the effects of large volcanic eruptions. Proponents suggest AAI could be a relatively inexpensive and rapidly deployable tool to offset some of the warming caused by greenhouse gases, potentially buying time for decarbonization efforts. The primary mechanism involves dispersing fine reflective particles, such as sulfur dioxide, into the stratosphere, where they would remain for a year or two, scattering sunlight. While the theoretical cooling potential is significant, the deployment of AAI is fraught with profound scientific uncertainties, governance dilemmas, and ethical quandaries.

One major concern is the potential for unintended climatic consequences. While AAI might reduce global average temperatures, its effects on regional climate patterns, suchin as monsoon systems and precipitation, are poorly understood and could be highly disruptive. Altering global atmospheric circulation could lead to droughts in some regions and floods in others, with severe implications for agriculture and water security. Furthermore, AAI does not address the root cause of climate change – greenhouse gas accumulation – and thus would not mitigate ocean acidification, a serious threat to marine ecosystems. There is also the risk of a ""termination shock"": if AAI were deployed for an extended period and then suddenly stopped, global temperatures could rebound rapidly to levels consistent with the accumulated greenhouse gases, potentially with catastrophic consequences.

The governance of AAI presents another formidable challenge. Unilateral deployment by a single nation or a small group of nations could lead to international tensions and conflicts, especially if perceived negative impacts are attributed to such actions. Establishing a global consensus on whether, when, and how to deploy AAI, along with mechanisms for monitoring, verification, and liability, would be an unprecedented feat of international cooperation. Moreover, the prospect of a ""quick fix"" like AAI could create a moral hazard, potentially reducing the urgency and political will for the more challenging but essential task of transitioning away from fossil fuels.

Is it justifiable for the current generation to embark on a planetary-scale intervention with potentially irreversible and inequitably distributed consequences for future generations and diverse ecosystems?

VARC,40,8A3B5C7D1_Q9,9,RC_Passage_3_DAOs,"The rise of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) presents a novel paradigm for organizational structure and governance, leveraging blockchain technology to enable collective action and resource management without traditional hierarchical control. DAOs operate through smart contracts – self-executing code on a blockchain – that define the rules for membership, voting, fund allocation, and operational protocols. Proponents champion DAOs for their potential to enhance transparency, democratize decision-making, and reduce agency costs often associated with conventional corporate structures where managers' interests may diverge from those of shareholders. By encoding rules on an immutable ledger, DAOs aim to create ""trustless"" systems where cooperation can occur even among anonymous or pseudonymous participants.

However, the path to widespread adoption and effective regulation of DAOs is riddled with complexities. One significant challenge lies in their legal status and liability. Most jurisdictions lack a clear legal framework for DAOs, leaving their members potentially exposed to unlimited personal liability for the organization's actions or debts. Defining who is responsible when a DAO, operating via autonomous code, causes harm or breaches agreements is a knotty problem. Furthermore, while transparency is a hallmark, the sheer volume of code and transaction data can be opaque to non-technical participants, potentially concentrating de facto power in the hands of developers or those adept at interpreting blockchain data. This ""tyranny of structurelessness"" can evolve into a tyranny of an unelected, technically proficient elite.

Governance in DAOs, though ostensibly democratic through token-based voting, also faces hurdles. Plutocracy can emerge if voting power is proportional to token holdings, allowing wealthy individuals or entities to dominate decisions. Ensuring meaningful participation from a diverse stakeholder base, preventing voter apathy, and designing mechanisms to resolve complex disputes efficiently are ongoing experiments. Moreover, the immutability of smart contracts, while a strength, can also be a weakness. If a flaw in the code is discovered or if the DAO needs to adapt to unforeseen circumstances, amending the governing rules can be cumbersome or, in some cases, impossible without a hard fork or the consent of a large majority, leading to inflexibility.

Regulators grapple with how to apply existing financial, securities, and corporate laws to these novel entities. The decentralized nature of DAOs, often spanning multiple jurisdictions with anonymous members, complicates oversight, tax collection, and the enforcement of anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. Striking a balance between fostering innovation in this nascent space and mitigating risks of fraud, investor harm, and systemic instability is a delicate task for policymakers worldwide.

Governance in DAOs, though ostensibly democratic through token-based voting, also faces hurdles. Plutocracy can emerge if voting power is proportional to token holdings, allowing wealthy individuals or entities to dominate decisions. Ensuring meaningful participation from a diverse stakeholder base, preventing voter apathy, and designing mechanisms to resolve complex disputes efficiently are ongoing experiments. Moreover, the immutability of smart contracts, while a strength, can also be a weakness. If a flaw in the code is discovered or if the DAO needs to adapt to unforeseen circumstances, amending the governing rules can be cumbersome or, in some cases, impossible without a hard fork or the consent of a large majority, leading to inflexibility.

Regulators grapple with how to apply existing financial, securities, and corporate laws to these novel entities.

It is not synonymous with skepticism, which might doubt the very possibility of knowledge, nor with a lack of conviction. Rather, epistemic humility involves an awareness that our perspectives are inherently partial, shaped by our experiences, biases, and the finite information available to us. It entails a willingness to consider alternative viewpoints, to revise one's own beliefs in the face of new evidence, and to acknowledge the possibility of being mistaken.

This intellectual virtue is rooted in a long philosophical tradition, from Socratic irony to Montaigne's essays on the elusiveness of truth. However, its application in an era of information abundance and algorithmically curated echo chambers presents unique challenges and underscores its critical importance. The sheer volume of available information does not necessarily translate to greater understanding; instead, it can paradoxically reinforce pre-existing biases if individuals selectively engage with sources that confirm their views, a phenomenon exacerbated by social media platforms. In such an environment, epistemic humility acts as a cognitive discipline, prompting individuals to critically evaluate the sources of their beliefs and to actively seek out disconfirming evidence or differing interpretations.

Cultivating epistemic humility has implications beyond individual cognitive habits; it can foster more productive dialogue and collective problem-solving. When participants in a discussion approach it with a degree of humility about their own certitude, they are more likely to listen genuinely to others, to engage with opposing arguments charitably, and to find common ground or synthesize diverse perspectives. This contrasts sharply with debates characterized by dogmatism, where the goal is often to ""win"" the argument rather than to arrive at a better understanding. However, epistemic humility should not be misconstrued as a call for intellectual passivity or a reluctance to defend well-reasoned positions.

A more nuanced understanding recognizes leaders as products and agents of their times, rather than as autonomous creators of history.",The passage given below is followed by four summaries. Choose the option that best captures the author’s position.,The Great Man theory accurately identifies the most important individuals who shaped history.,"Historical change is solely determined by broad socio-economic and technological forces, with individuals playing no significant role.","While influential individuals can impact history, a comprehensive understanding must also consider the broader societal forces and contexts that shape historical events.",Contemporary historians have completely debunked the idea that individuals can have any significant influence on the course of history.,A,B,C,D,C,MCQ,VA,Para Summary (Essence of the Paragraph),Medium,Main Idea Identification / Direct Application,"sub_topic: Para Summary (Essence of the Paragraph), concept_tested: Main Idea Identification / Direct Application, difficulty: Medium",False,MockSet1_VARC,Analysis,"(C) While influential individuals can impact history, a comprehensive understanding must also consider the broader societal forces and contexts that shape historical events.
The passage critiques the ""Great Man"" theory for oversimplification, stating ""contemporary historians emphasize the broader interplay of social, economic, cultural, and technological forces"" and that a ""more nuanced understanding recognizes leaders as products and agents of their times."" This supports the idea of individual impact within a larger context.
(A) contradicts the passage's critique of the Great Man theory.
(B) is too extreme; the passage says ""While acknowledging the impact of remarkable figures...""
(D) is too strong; the passage suggests a nuanced view where individuals are ""agents,"" not that they have no influence."

2. Habitat fragmentation, often resulting from human activities like agriculture and urbanization, divides large, continuous habitats into smaller, isolated patches.
3. This isolation can impede the movement of organisms, restrict gene flow, and increase the vulnerability of populations to local extinction.
4. Such efforts often involve creating wildlife corridors or stepping-stone habitats to link the fragmented areas.","The sentences given below, when properly sequenced, form a coherent paragraph.

Sentence 2 introduces the concept of ""Habitat fragmentation"" and its cause, making it a good starting point.
Sentence 3 explains the negative consequences of the isolation caused by fragmentation described in sentence 2 (""This isolation can impede..."").
Sentence 1 presents a logical consequence or objective (""Consequently, a key objective..."") arising from the problems stated in sentence 3.
Sentence 4 provides examples of efforts (""Such efforts often involve creating wildlife corridors..."") to achieve the objective mentioned in sentence 1.
The flow is: Definition/Cause (2) -> Negative Effects (3) -> Consequent Objective (1) -> Examples of Efforts for Objective (4)."
VARC,40,8A3B5C7D1_Q24,24,VA_SentencePlacement_Q24,"Paragraph: The notion of ""progress"" has been a dominant narrative in Western thought for centuries, often associated with scientific advancement, technological innovation, and economic growth. (1) This perspective typically envisions history as a linear trajectory moving towards an ever-better future. (2) Moreover, the material benefits of such progress have not been evenly distributed, often exacerbating inequalities. (3) Therefore, a critical re-evaluation of what constitutes genuine progress, and for whom, is increasingly necessary. (4)

Sentence to be placed: However, critics argue that this narrative often overlooks the social and environmental costs, such as cultural disruption, ecological degradation, and the displacement of communities.",A paragraph is given below with four numbered blanks. A sentence is also provided. Identify the blank number where the given sentence fits most logically and coherently.,(1),(2),(3),(4),A,B,C,D,B,MCQ,VA,Para Completion (Fill in the Blank / Last Sentence),Hard,Contextual Fit & Logical Extension / Direct Application,"sub_topic: Para Completion (Fill in the Blank / Last Sentence), concept_tested: Contextual Fit & Logical Extension / Direct Application, difficulty: Hard",False,MockSet1_VARC,Analysis,"(B) (2)
Paragraph structure:
Introduction to ""progress"" narrative: ""The notion of 'progress' has been a dominant narrative...""
This is followed by sentence (1): ""This perspective typically envisions history as a linear trajectory..."" which elaborates on the narrative.
The sentence to be placed: ""However, critics argue that this narrative often overlooks the social and environmental costs..."" introduces a contrasting viewpoint (critique).
This critique naturally fits *after* the elaboration of the narrative (sentence 1) and *before* sentence (2) ""Moreover, the material benefits of such progress have not been evenly distributed..."" which *adds* another layer to the critique (the ""Moreover"" connects to the newly introduced critical aspects from the placed sentence).
Sentence (3) ""Therefore, a critical re-evaluation..."" is a conclusion drawn from all the preceding criticisms.
Placing the sentence at blank (2) allows the ""However"" to directly contrast with the ideas in sentence (1), and then sentence (2) (""Moreover..."") can smoothly add another point to the criticism introduced by the placed sentence.
If at (1): The critique would be introduced before the narrative it is critiquing is fully elaborated.
If at (C) or (D): The critique would come too late, after a point (""Moreover..."") that already builds upon unstated criticisms or after the conclusion."
