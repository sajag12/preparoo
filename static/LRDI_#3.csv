Six shooters – Archer, Bowman, Casey, David, Eagle, Flint – participated in a three-phase target shooting tournament.
Rules:
1.  Phase 1: All six shooters participate. Each shooter takes 3 shots, with a maximum score of 100 per shot (max total 300 for the phase). The top four shooters based on Phase 1 scores qualify for Phase 2.
2.  Phase 2: The four qualified shooters participate. Each takes 3 shots (max total 300 for the phase). Casey's Phase 2 score was 255.
3.  Phase 3: The four qualified shooters participate again. Each takes 3 shots (max total 300 for the phase).
4.  Final Score: The final score for each of the four qualified shooters is the sum of their scores from Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3.

Six shooters – Archer, Bowman, Casey, David, Eagle, Flint – participated in a three-phase target shooting tournament.
Rules:
1.  Phase 1: All six shooters participate. Each shooter takes 3 shots, with a maximum score of 100 per shot (max total 300 for the phase). The top four shooters based on Phase 1 scores qualify for Phase 2.
2.  Phase 2: The four qualified shooters participate. Each takes 3 shots (max total 300 for the phase). Casey's Phase 2 score was 255.
3.  Phase 3: The four qualified shooters participate again. Each takes 3 shots (max total 300 for the phase).
4.  Final Score: The final score for each of the four qualified shooters is the sum of their scores from Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3.
5.  Ranking: Shooters are ranked based on their Final Scores. In case of a tie in Final Scores, the shooter with a higher Phase 3 score gets a better rank. If Phase 3 scores are also tied, the shooter with a higher Phase 2 score gets a better rank.
6.  All scores in all phases are distinct positive integers and are multiples of 5.
Information:
i.  Archer, Bowman, Casey, and David qualified for Phase 2. Eagle and Flint were eliminated after Phase 1. Flint had the lowest Phase 1 score among all six shooters.
ii. Archer’s Phase 1 score was 280. Bowman’s Phase 1 score was 275.
iii. The sum of Phase 1 scores for Eagle and Flint was 500. Eagle’s Phase 1 score was 10 more than Flint’s Phase 1 score.
iv. Casey’s Phase 1 score was equal to David’s Phase 2 score.
v.  In Phase 2, Archer scored 20 points less than Bowman. Bowman scored 285 in Phase 2.
vi. David’s combined score from Phase 1 and Phase 2 (P1+P2) was 530.

3.  Let N(all 4) = x. Then N(exactly 3 activities) = 3x (Info 6).
4.  Total students = N(only) + N(exactly 2) + N(exactly 3) + N(all 4).
    150 = 70 + 60 + 3x + x
    150 = 130 + 4x => 4x = 20 => x = 5.
    So, N(DQRM) = 5 (students in all four activities).
    N(exactly 3 activities) = 3 * 5 = 15.
5.  Specific ""exactly three"" counts:
    N(DRM only) = 14 (Info 12). ""only"" here means not Quiz.
    N(DQM only) = 0 (Info 13). ""only"" here means not Drama.
    N(QRM only) = 0 (Info 14). ""only"" here means not Debate.
    Let N(DQR only) be the students in Debate, Quiz, Drama but not Music.
    Sum of ""exactly three"" = N(DQR only) + N(DRM only) + N(DQM only) + N(QRM only) = 15.
    N(DQR only) + 14 + 0 + 0 = 15 => N(DQR only) = 1.
6.  Information on intersections:
    *   N(QM only) = 8 (Info 10). This is students in Quiz and Music, and no other activity.
    *   N((D ∩ R) \ Q) = 18 (Info 9). This means N(DR only) + N(DRM only) = 18.
        Since N(DRM only) = 14, N(DR only) = 18 - 14 = 4.
    *   N(D ∩ Q) = 38 (Info 7). This means N(DQ only) + N(DQR only) + N(DQM only) + N(DQRM) = 38.
        N(DQ only) + 1 + 0 + 5 = 38 => N(DQ only) = 38 - 6 = 32.
    *   N(R ∩ M) = 35 (Info 8). This means N(RM only) + N(DRM only) + N(QRM only) + N(DQRM) = 35.
        N(RM only) + 14 + 0 + 5 = 35 => N(RM only) = 35 - 19 = 16.
7.  Total N(exactly 2) = N(DQ only) + N(DR only) + N(DM only) + N(QR only) + N(QM only) + N(RM only) = 60.
    32 + 4 + N(DM only) + N(QR only) + 8 + 16 = 60.
    60 + N(DM only) + N(QR only) = 60 => N(DM only) + N(QR only) = 0.
    Since counts must be non-negative, N(DM only) = 0 and N(QR only) = 0.
8.  Check N(D) = 76 (Info 11).
    N(D) = N(D only) + N(DQ only) + N(DR only) + N(DM only) + N(DQR only) + N(DQM only) + N(DRM only) + N(DQRM)
    N(D) = 20 + 32 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 14 + 5 = 76. This is consistent.

Summary of counts:
*   N(DQRM) = 5 (all four)
*   N(exactly 3): N(DQR only)=1, N(DRM only)=14, N(DQM only)=0, N(QRM only)=0. (Sum=15)
*   N(exactly 2): N(DQ only)=32, N(DR only)=4, N(DM only)=0, N(QR only)=0, N(QM only)=8, N(RM only)=16. (Sum=60)
*   N(only): N(D only)=20, N(Q only)=15, N(R only)=25, N(M only)=10. (Sum=70)
Total = 5 + 15 + 60 + 70 = 150.

**Answer to Q13:** From our calculations, the number of students in Quiz and Drama only, N(QR only), is 0. We need to find another 'exactly two' category with 0 students. From the calculations, N(DM only) is also 0. So, 'Quiz and Drama only' (0) is equal to 'Debate and Music only' (0)."
