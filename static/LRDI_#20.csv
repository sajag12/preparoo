A company is staffing its projects with a total of 120 employees from four departments: Engineering, Marketing, Finance, and Operations. Staff are categorized by three skill levels: Junior, Mid-Level, and Senior. Projects are of two types: Internal and Client-Facing. Each distinct combination of Department, Skill Level, and Project Type must have a non-negative integer number of staff allocated.
The following information is known:
1.	The total number of Junior staff allocated across all projects is 40. The total number of Mid-Level staff is 50.
2.	The Engineering department has a total of 35 staff. The Operations department also has a total of 35 staff.
3.	The total number of staff allocated to Internal projects is 49.
4.	Marketing department has no Senior staff working on Internal projects. Finance department has no Junior staff working on Internal projects. Operations department has no Junior staff working on Client-Facing projects.
5.	In the Engineering department, the number of Mid-Level staff on Client-Facing projects is twice the number of Mid-Level staff on Internal projects. The number of Junior staff on Internal projects is one more than the number of Junior staff on Client-Facing projects.
6.	The Marketing department has a total of 25 staff. The number of Senior staff in Marketing (all on Client-Facing projects) is equal to the number of Mid-Level staff on Internal projects in Engineering.

Let Jr, Mid, Sr denote Junior, Mid-Level, Senior staff. Let I, C denote Internal, Client-Facing projects.
Departments: Eng (Engineering), Mkt (Marketing), Fin (Finance), Ops (Operations).

**Overall Totals & Basic Deductions:**
1.  Total Staff = 120.
2.  Total Jr = 40, Total Mid = 50 (Clue 1). So, Total Sr = 120 - 40 - 50 = 30.
3.  Eng_Total = 35, Ops_Total = 35 (Clue 2).
4.  Mkt_Total = 25 (Clue 6), Fin_Total = 25 (Clue 7). (Check: 35+35+25+25 = 120. OK).
5.  Total Internal projects staff = 49 (Clue 3). So, Total Client-Facing projects staff = 120 - 49 = 71.
6.  Zero Allocations (Clue 4): Mkt_Sr_I = 0, Fin_Jr_I = 0, Ops_Jr_C = 0.

**Defining Variables based on Clues:**
*   From Clue 5 (Eng): Let Eng_Mid_I = `x`. Then Eng_Mid_C = `2x`. So, Eng_Mid_Total = `3x`.
    Let Eng_Jr_C = `y`. Then Eng_Jr_I = `y+1`. So, Eng_Jr_Total = `2y+1`.
*   From Clue 6 (Mkt): Mkt_Sr_C = Eng_Mid_I = `x`. Since Mkt_Sr_I = 0, Mkt_Sr_Total = `x`.
*   From Clue 7 (Fin): Fin_Jr_C = Eng_Mid_C = `2x`. Since Fin_Jr_I = 0, Fin_Jr_Total = `2x`.
*   From Clue 8 (Ops): Let Ops_Sr_I = `a`. Then Ops_Sr_C = `2a`. So, Ops_Sr_Total = `3a`.
    Let Ops_Mid_C = `b`. Then Ops_Mid_I = `b+1`. So, Ops_Mid_Total = `2b+1`.

**Deriving Departmental Skill Totals in terms of x,y,a,b:**
*   Eng_Sr_Total = Eng_Total - Eng_Jr_Total - Eng_Mid_Total = 35 - (2y+1) - 3x = `34 - 3x - 2y`.
*   Ops_Jr_Total (which is Ops_Jr_I as Ops_Jr_C=0) = Ops_Total - Ops_Mid_Total - Ops_Sr_Total = 35 - (2b+1) - 3a = `34 - 3a - 2b`.
*   Mkt_Jr_Total + Mkt_Mid_Total = Mkt_Total - Mkt_Sr_Total = `25 - x`.
*   Fin_Mid_Total + Fin_Sr_Total = Fin_Total - Fin_Jr_Total = `25 - 2x`.

**Using Overall Skill Level Totals to find expressions for remaining totals:**
*   Total Jr = 40: (Eng_Jr_Total) + Mkt_Jr_Total + (Fin_Jr_Total) + (Ops_Jr_Total) = 40
    (2y+1) + Mkt_Jr_Total + (2x) + (34 - 3a - 2b) = 40
    Mkt_Jr_Total = 40 - 35 - 2x - 2y + 3a + 2b = `5 - 2x - 2y + 3a + 2b`.
*   Total Sr = 30: (Eng_Sr_Total) + (Mkt_Sr_Total) + Fin_Sr_Total + (Ops_Sr_Total) = 30
    (34 - 3x - 2y) + (x) + Fin_Sr_Total + (3a) = 30
    Fin_Sr_Total = 30 - 34 + 2x + 2y - 3a = `-4 + 2x + 2y - 3a`.
*   From Mkt_Jr_Total + Mkt_Mid_Total = 25 - x:
    Mkt_Mid_Total = (25 - x) - (5 - 2x - 2y + 3a + 2b) = `20 + x + 2y - 3a - 2b`.
*   From Fin_Mid_Total + Fin_Sr_Total = 25 - 2x:
    Fin_Mid_Total = (25 - 2x) - (-4 + 2x + 2y - 3a) = `29 - 4x - 2y + 3a`.

This process confirms the unique solution: `x = 5`, `y = 7`, `a = 5`, `b = 7`.

**Calculating Specific Department-Skill Totals:**
With x=5, y=7, a=5, b=7:
*   Eng: Jr_Total (2(7)+1)=15; Mid_Total (3(5))=15; Sr_Total (34-3(5)-2(7))=5.
    *   Eng_Jr_I = 7+1=8, Eng_Jr_C=7.

    *   Fin_Mid_Total = (29-4(5)-2(7)+3(5)) = 10.

**Distributing Staff between Internal (I) and Client-Facing (C) Projects:**

Let Jr, Mid, Sr denote Junior, Mid-Level, Senior staff. Let I, C denote Internal, Client-Facing projects.
Departments: Eng (Engineering), Mkt (Marketing), Fin (Finance), Ops (Operations).

**Overall Totals & Basic Deductions:**
1.  Total Staff = 120.
2.  Total Jr = 40, Total Mid = 50 (Clue 1). So, Total Sr = 120 - 40 - 50 = 30.
3.  Eng_Total = 35, Ops_Total = 35 (Clue 2).
4.  Mkt_Total = 25 (Clue 6), Fin_Total = 25 (Clue 7). (Check: 35+35+25+25 = 120. OK).
5.  Total Internal projects staff = 49 (Clue 3). So, Total Client-Facing projects staff = 120 - 49 = 71.
6.  Zero Allocations (Clue 4): Mkt_Sr_I = 0, Fin_Jr_I = 0, Ops_Jr_C = 0.

**Defining Variables based on Clues:**
*   From Clue 5 (Eng): Let Eng_Mid_I = `x`. Then Eng_Mid_C = `2x`. So, Eng_Mid_Total = `3x`.
    Let Eng_Jr_C = `y`. Then Eng_Jr_I = `y+1`. So, Eng_Jr_Total = `2y+1`.
*   From Clue 6 (Mkt): Mkt_Sr_C = Eng_Mid_I = `x`. Since Mkt_Sr_I = 0, Mkt_Sr_Total = `x`.
*   From Clue 7 (Fin): Fin_Jr_C = Eng_Mid_C = `2x`. Since Fin_Jr_I = 0, Fin_Jr_Total = `2x`.
*   From Clue 8 (Ops): Let Ops_Sr_I = `a`. Then Ops_Sr_C = `2a`. So, Ops_Sr_Total = `3a`.
    Let Ops_Mid_C = `b`. Then Ops_Mid_I = `b+1`. So, Ops_Mid_Total = `2b+1`.

**Deriving Departmental Skill Totals in terms of x,y,a,b:**
*   Eng_Sr_Total = Eng_Total - Eng_Jr_Total - Eng_Mid_Total = 35 - (2y+1) - 3x = `34 - 3x - 2y`.
*   Ops_Jr_Total (which is Ops_Jr_I as Ops_Jr_C=0) = Ops_Total - Ops_Mid_Total - Ops_Sr_Total = 35 - (2b+1) - 3a = `34 - 3a - 2b`.
*   Mkt_Jr_Total + Mkt_Mid_Total = Mkt_Total - Mkt_Sr_Total = `25 - x`.
*   Fin_Mid_Total + Fin_Sr_Total = Fin_Total - Fin_Jr_Total = `25 - 2x`.

**Using Overall Skill Level Totals to find expressions for remaining totals:**
*   Total Jr = 40: (Eng_Jr_Total) + Mkt_Jr_Total + (Fin_Jr_Total) + (Ops_Jr_Total) = 40
    (2y+1) + Mkt_Jr_Total + (2x) + (34 - 3a - 2b) = 40
    Mkt_Jr_Total = 40 - 35 - 2x - 2y + 3a + 2b = `5 - 2x - 2y + 3a + 2b`.
*   Total Sr = 30: (Eng_Sr_Total) + (Mkt_Sr_Total) + Fin_Sr_Total + (Ops_Sr_Total) = 30
    (34 - 3x - 2y) + (x) + Fin_Sr_Total + (3a) = 30
    Fin_Sr_Total = 30 - 34 + 2x + 2y - 3a = `-4 + 2x + 2y - 3a`.
*   From Mkt_Jr_Total + Mkt_Mid_Total = 25 - x:
    Mkt_Mid_Total = (25 - x) - (5 - 2x - 2y + 3a + 2b) = `20 + x + 2y - 3a - 2b`.
*   From Fin_Mid_Total + Fin_Sr_Total = 25 - 2x:
    Fin_Mid_Total = (25 - 2x) - (-4 + 2x + 2y - 3a) = `29 - 4x - 2y + 3a`.

This process confirms the unique solution: `x = 5`, `y = 7`, `a = 5`, `b = 7`.

**Calculating Specific Department-Skill Totals:**
With x=5, y=7, a=5, b=7:

B) Marketing Jr_C = 6. Operations Jr_I = 5. So B is true (6 > 5).
C) Total Sr_I = Eng_Sr_I(2) + Mkt_Sr_I(0) + Fin_Sr_I(3) + Ops_Sr_I(5) = 10. Not 15. So C is false.
D) Mid_C staff: Eng=10, Mkt=7, Fin=4, Ops=7. Engineering has the highest (10). So D is false."

Five islands—Aethel, Burg, Cyne, Dun, and Ead—form an economic collective. Each island has specific daily production of one primary resource (Wood (W), Stone (S), or Food (F)), daily consumption of other resources, and some initial storage. Resources can be transported between islands using specific routes, each with a travel time and a per-trip capacity. A trip's capacity can be a mix of resources. Assume transport is instantaneous once a trip is completed (no loading/unloading time beyond travel).

**Q8 Solution:** Cyne needs 5W (Wood) and 5S (Stone). We need the minimum time by which Cyne can have *both* delivered. Resources are available at source islands at T=0.
1.  **Delivery of 5W to Cyne:** The fastest source is Burg, which has 5W in storage. Route B->C takes 3 hours.
2.  **Delivery of 5S to Cyne:** The fastest source is Burg, which produces 15S. Route B->C takes 3 hours.
3.  **Combined delivery:** Burg can supply both the 5W (from its storage) and 5S (from its daily production). The total amount to be transported is 5W + 5S = 10 units. The route B->C has a capacity of 12 units, so a single trip is sufficient. The travel time is 3 hours. Therefore, Cyne can receive both resources from Burg by T=3 hours."

Five islands—Aethel, Burg, Cyne, Dun, and Ead—form an economic collective. Each island has specific daily production of one primary resource (Wood (W), Stone (S), or Food (F)), daily consumption of other resources, and some initial storage. Resources can be transported between islands using specific routes, each with a travel time and a per-trip capacity. A trip's capacity can be a mix of resources. Assume transport is instantaneous once a trip is completed (no loading/unloading time beyond travel).
Island Details:
•	Aethel: Produces 10 units of Wood (W) per day. Consumes 8 units of Food (F) per day. Starts with 5 units of Stone (S) in storage.
•	Burg: Produces 15 units of Stone (S) per day. Consumes 10 units of Food (F) per day. Starts with 5 units of Wood (W) in storage.
•	Cyne: Produces 20 units of Food (F) per day. Consumes 5 units of Wood (W) and 5 units of Stone (S) per day. Starts with no resources in storage.
•	Dun: Produces 8 units of Wood (W) per day. Consumes 6 units of Stone (S) per day. Starts with 10 units of Food (F) in storage.

**Q9 Solution:** Burg wants to maximize its net Food. Burg consumes 10F/day. It must import Food. The new route Aethel-Cyne (2.5h, 15u) does not directly involve Burg, but can alter the network flows.
1.  **Sources of Food for Burg:** Cyne (produces 20F), Dun (starts with 10F).
2.  **Maximum Import:** Burg can import up to 20F from Cyne (via C->B route, 3 hours) and up to 10F from Dun (via D->E->B, total 3.5 hours). All routes are feasible within Day 1.
3.  **Total Food Inflow:** Burg can potentially import 20F (from Cyne) + 10F (from Dun) = 30F.
4.  **Burg's Net Food:** Burg starts with 0F, imports 30F, and consumes 10F. Net Food at end of Day 1 = 0 + 30 - 10 = 20 units. The new route doesn't inhibit the flow of food to Burg; other islands' needs can be met by the existing network, allowing Cyne and Dun to send their maximum available food to Burg."

Three bidders, Collector A, Museum B, and Private Hoarder C, are participating in a sealed-bid auction for five distinct artifacts: a Vase, a Scroll, a Sword, a Coin, and a Tablet. Each artifact will be sold to the highest bidder for that specific artifact, provided the bidder has sufficient budget remaining.
Auction Rules & Information:
1.	Each bidder has an initial total budget: Collector A has 200 units, Museum B has 250 units, and Private Hoarder C has 180 units.
2.	Bids are placed simultaneously for all five artifacts. A bidder may choose not to bid on an artifact (effectively a bid of 0). All bids are positive integers.
3.	For each artifact, the highest bidder wins it and pays their bid amount. This amount is deducted from their remaining budget. The artifacts are processed for winners in the following order for budget deduction purposes: Vase, Scroll, Sword, Coin, Tablet.
4.	If the highest bidder for an artifact (at the moment it is processed) does not have enough remaining budget to cover their bid, they do not win the artifact. In such a case, the next highest bidder for that artifact who can afford their bid (from their budget current at that processing moment) wins the artifact at their own bid price. If no bidder can afford their bid, the artifact remains unsold.
5.	In case of a tie in bids for an artifact, a pre-determined priority (A > B > C) decides the winner among tied bidders, provided they can afford it.

    Weighted Score = 0.4(9) + 0.2(8) + 0.3(8) + 0.1(5) = 3.6 + 1.6 + 2.4 + 0.5 = 8.1
2.  **P3 from R2:** Scores (I=8, F=9, M=7, B=6)
    Weighted Score = 0.2(8) + 0.4(9) + 0.2(7) + 0.2(6) = 1.6 + 3.6 + 1.4 + 1.2 = 7.8
3.  **P3 from R3:** Scores (I=U=8, F=7, M=9, B=8)
    Weighted Score = 0.3(8) + 0.1(7) + 0.4(9) + 0.2(8) = 2.4 + 0.7 + 3.6 + 1.6 = 8.3
4.  **Final Average Score for P3:**
    Average = (8.1 + 7.8 + 8.3) / 3 = 24.2 / 3 = 8.066... ≈ 8.07"

Five research proposals (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5) are evaluated by three reviewers (R1, R2, R3). Each reviewer scores each proposal on four criteria: Innovation (I), Feasibility (F), Impact (M), and Budget Justification (B). All scores are integers from 1 to 10. Each reviewer assigns a personal set of positive weights to these four criteria, and the sum of these four weights for any reviewer is 1. A proposal's weighted score from a reviewer is the sum of (score * weight) for each criterion. The final score for a proposal is the average of its weighted scores from the three reviewers. Proposals are funded based on their final scores.
