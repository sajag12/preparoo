From Clue 5, the total number of units involved in at least Transportation (|T|) is 1100.
The total number of units in Transportation can be broken down as:
|T| = |T only| + |(T ∩ S) \ M| + |(T ∩ M) \ S| + |T ∩ S ∩ M|.
Substituting the known values:
1100 = 150 (Clue 1) + 300 (Clue 7) + x + 400 (Clue 4).
1100 = 850 + x.
x = 1100 - 850 = 250.

From b + p + m = 53, we get b + p = 53 - m.
The constraint m > b + p becomes m > 53 - m => 2m > 53 => m > 26.5. So, m ≥ 27.
Substitute b = 53 - m - p into the revenue equation b + 2p + 4m = 200:
(53 - m - p) + 2p + 4m = 200
53 + 3m + p = 200 => p = 147 - 3m.
Since p must be a non-negative integer, p ≥ 0:
147 - 3m ≥ 0 => 147 ≥ 3m => m ≤ 49.
Also, b must be a non-negative integer. b = 53 - m - p. Substitute p = 147 - 3m:
b = 53 - m - (147 - 3m) = 53 - m - 147 + 3m = 2m - 94.
Since b ≥ 0:
2m - 94 ≥ 0 => 2m ≥ 94 => m ≥ 47.
Combining the conditions for m: m ≥ 47 and m ≤ 49.
The possible integer values for m are 47, 48, 49.
We must also ensure m > b+p for each.
