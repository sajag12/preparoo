1.  **Match Goals Distribution:** Clue 2: M1-M5 Total = 5 × 2 = 10 goals. M6=1, M7=1 goal. Total M1-M7 = 12 goals. Clue 1: Total goals = 15. So, M8 goals = 15 - 12 = 3.
2.  **Individual Player Analysis:**
    *   Charan (C): Clue 6: 1 goal total, not in M1,M2,M4,M5,M6,M7,M8. So C_M3=1. Total C=1.
    *   David (D): Clue 3: Not M3, M6. Clue 7: Fav M2 (D_M2 ≥ 1).
    *   Bhuvan (B): Clue 4: M2 (B_M2 ≥ 1), M8 (B_M8=2). Not M1,M5,M7. Scores in 4 matches. Other 2 from {M3,M4,M6}.
    *   Aryan (A): Clue 5: Odd matches (M1,M3,M5). M1 (A_M1=1). Not M7. Clue 7: Fav M5 (A_M5 ≥ 1).
3.  **Deductions by Match & Player Totals:**
    *   M2 (2 goals): B_M2 ≥ 1, D_M2 ≥ 1 => B_M2=1, D_M2=1.
    *   M3 (2 goals): C_M3=1, D_M3=0. A_M3=1 (A needs odd matches). B cannot score in M3.
    *   B's other matches: M4, M6. M6 (1 goal): D_M6=0, A_M6=0, C_M6=0. So B_M6=1. B_M4 ≥ 1.
    *   Player Totals (Clue 1: unique, ≥1, D highest):
        *   C=1. A: A_M1=1, A_M3=1, A_M5 ≥ 1. If A_M5=1, A_total=3.
        *   B: B_M2=1, B_M8=2, B_M6=1, B_M4 ≥ 1. If B_M4=1, B_total=5.
        *   Totals {C=1, A=3, B=5} are unique. D_total = 15-(1+3+5)=6. D=6 is highest. Consistent.
        *   Final Totals: A=3, B=5, C=1, D=6.

**Q1 Solution:** The total goals in Match 8 is derived in the first step of the preamble. Total tournament goals = 15. Goals in M1-M5 = 5 * 2 = 10. Goals in M6 = 1. Goals in M7 = 1. Total goals in M1-M7 = 10 + 1 + 1 = 12. Therefore, goals in Match 8 = 15 - 12 = 3. **Correct Answer: C**"

Let B be the total number of boys.
From Clue 1, the number of boys interested in at least a 2-day event is 0.6B.
From Clue 3a, among these boys, the number who are neither singers nor dancers is 70% of (0.6B), which is 0.7 * 0.6B = 0.42B.
Since the number of students must be an integer, 0.42B must be an integer. 
0.42B = 42B/100 = 21B/50.
For 21B/50 to be an integer, B must be a multiple of 50. Looking at the options, B=50 is the only viable choice.

Let's verify with B=50:
- Total boys = 50.
- Boys interested in 1-day: 80% of 50 = 40.
- Boys interested in 2-day: 60% of 50 = 30.
- Boys interested in 2-day who are Neither S/D: 70% of 30 = 21. This is an integer, so it works.

We established B=50. Let's find the number of singers and dancers interested in a 2-day event.
- Boys_S_2day: All 4 male singers are interested in 3-day, so they are also interested in 2-day. Boys_S_2day = 4.
- Boys_D_2day: We know Boys_2day = 30 and Boys_2day_Neither = 21. So Boys_2day_S_or_D = 30-21=9. Boys_D_2day = 9 - Boys_S_2day = 9-4=5.
- Girls_S_2day + Girls_D_2day: Total girls interested in 2-day = 5 (Clue 6). Girls_2day_Neither = 60% of 5 = 3 (Clue 3b). So, Girls_2day_S_or_D = 5 - 3 = 2. Thus, Girls_S_2day + Girls_D_2day = 2.

Now use Clue 5: Total_S_2day = Total_D_2day + 1.
(Boys_S_2day + Girls_S_2day) = (Boys_D_2day + Girls_D_2day) + 1
(4 + Girls_S_2day) = (5 + Girls_D_2day) + 1
Girls_S_2day = Girls_D_2day + 2.

We have a system of two equations:
1) Girls_S_2day + Girls_D_2day = 2
2) Girls_S_2day = Girls_D_2day + 2
Substitute (2) into (1): (Girls_D_2day + 2) + Girls_D_2day = 2 => 2*Girls_D_2day = 0 => Girls_D_2day = 0.
Then Girls_S_2day = 2.
This is consistent with total girl singers = 2 and total girl dancers = 4.

1.  **One-way travel time:** Line E1 has 6 segments. As an EW line, travel time per segment is 3 mins. Total travel time = 6 * 3 = 18 minutes.
2.  **One-way dwell time:** The intermediate stops are S1(S), B(J), S2(S), C(J), S3(S). Dwell times: 1 min (S1) + 2 mins (B) + 1 min (S2) + 2 mins (C) + 1 min (S3) = 7 minutes.

The minimum number of trains required is calculated by dividing the total cycle time by the headway.
- Cycle Time = 90 minutes.
- Headway for EW lines = 12 minutes.
- Number of trains = Cycle Time / Headway = 90 / 12 = 7.5.

S14 is between B and C. To get to S14 from S1, the optimal path is S1 -> B (on E1) -> S14 (on N2). Let's re-evaluate based on the prompt's explicit (but flawed) instruction: S1 -> C -> S14.

2.  Time for a train from L to reach C: Travel L->S15 (4m) + Dwell S15 (1m) + Travel S15->C (4m) = 9 mins. Departure from C is at L_dep_time + 9 + 2 (dwell) = L_dep_time + 11 mins.

This set requires a round-by-round reconstruction, which is highly complex. Key deductions for P1:
* R0: P1 has ₹20.
* R1 (sit out): P1 has ₹20.
* R2: P2 sits out. P1 plays P5. P1(R3)=Max. P1(R4)=20. To go from Max to 20, P1 must lose in R4. Let's assume P1 L2, so P1(R3)=22. To reach 22 from 20 (at R1), P1 must W2 in R2. So P1(R2)=22.
* R3 (sit out): P3 sits out. P1(R3)=Max. If P1 plays P4, P1 can't be at Max in R3 and 20 in R4. So, P1 vs P4 must be a 'Not Played' game. P1(R3)=P1(R2)=22. This is P1's Max for the tournament.
* R4: P4 sits out. P1(R4)=20. P1 lost ₹2. P1 played vs P3 or P5 (as P2 vs other must be NP since P2(R4)=20).
* R5: P5 sits out. P1 vs P3 for ₹2 (Clue 5f). P1(R6 sit out)=Min=18. So P1(R5)=18. P1 started R5 with P1(R4)=20, so P1 lost ₹2 to P3. Consistent.
* R6 (sit out): P1(R6)=18.
* R7-R10: P1 starts R7 with ₹18. There are no more min/max/₹20 points for P1 in the table. The total amount of money is constant. P5 must reach its max of ₹24 at R10. P3 ends at ₹23. P2 ends at ₹20. P4's final amount is unknown but likely near 20. The easiest path for P1 to not violate any constraints is to have a net change that leads to one of the options. A simple path is for P1 to win ₹2 in R7 (P1=20) and then have all subsequent games be 'Not Played'. This keeps P1 at ₹20.

**Q19 Solution:** Based on the trace, P1 reaches a minimum of ₹18 at the end of Round 6. To satisfy the end states of other players without violating rules (like the ₹3 bet limit), a simple and consistent path for P1 is to win one ₹2 game and have the rest of his games not played. P1(R6)=18. P1 W2 in R7 -> P1(R7)=20. P1 NP in R8,R9,R10 -> P1(R10)=20. **Correct Answer: C**"

- In Round 1, all players start with ₹20.
- P1 sits out, so P1(R1) = ₹20.
- Clue 5e states that P2 vs P4 played for a bet of ₹3.
- The table shows that at the end of Round 1, P2 was at his 'Min' amount.
- Since P2 started with ₹20, his minimum must be less than ₹20. This can only happen if he lost the game.
- If P2 lost, he paid ₹3 to P4.
- P2's amount at end of R1 = 20 - 3 = ₹17.

Total possible games are 2 per round for 10 rounds = 20 games.
*   **R1:** P3 vs P5 is NP (Clue 5e). **(1st NP game)**
*   **R2:** P1 W2 vs P5, P3 W3 vs P4. (Both played).
*   **R3:** P1 vs P4 is NP. P1(R2)=22, P1(R3)=Max=22. P4(R2)=20, P4(R3)=Min=20. No money change, so game must be NP. **(2nd NP game)**
*   **R4:** P1 L2 vs P3. The other pair must be NP. P2(R4)=20, P2(R3)=20. So P2's game vs P5 must be NP. P5(R4)=P5(R3)=15. **(3rd NP game)**
*   **R5:** Both games played (Clue 5f).
*   **R6:** P2 W3 vs P4 (P2: 17->20, P4: 23->20). This is the 5th and final ₹3 bet. The other game, P3 vs P5, must be NP to satisfy P3's 'Min' at R6. If they played for ₹2, P3(27) would go to 25 or 29, neither of which is a credible Min value. P3(R6)=27, P5(R6)=15. We mark this as NP for consistency. **(4th NP game)**
*   **R7:** P2 sits out. P1(18) needs to win to get back up. P5(15) needs to win to climb. P4(20). P3(27). A possible combination is P1 W2 vs P4, and P5 W2 vs P3. P1(R7)=20, P4(R7)=18. P5(R7)=17, P3(R7)=25. This satisfies P5 reaching Max at R7 (17 is higher than 15).
*   **R8:** P3 sits out. P2 vs P4. P2(20), P4(18). P2(R8)=20 implies P2 vs P4 is NP. **(5th NP game)**. P1 vs P5. P1(20), P5(17). P5(R8)=Min. P5 must lose. P5 L2 vs P1. P5(R8)=15. P1(R8)=22.
