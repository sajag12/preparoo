* R1: LT in Cycle A (Jan-Dec). No grant in Cycle B.
* R4: No grant in Cycle A. LT in Cycle B (Jul-Jun next year).
* R2 & R5: MT in Cycle A (Jan-Jun). Since R2 has an ST grant (implied by Clue 6), it must be in Cycle B (Jul-Sep). R5's Cycle B grant starts in Aug, so it must be an ST grant (Aug-Oct) to finish by Dec.
* R3: To fit within Cycle A without starting in Jan, R3 must have an ST grant (e.g., Apr-Jun). R3's Cycle B grant must be MT (Jul-Dec).
* R6: Has one ST grant. All available slots for an ST grant are in Cycle A (e.g., Feb-Apr).

Step 2: Determine Grant Funding
* Total Budget = ₹275L. Total ST Funding = ₹70L.
* Let R2(B,ST) = X. Then R6(A,ST) = X+5. Max ST grant is ₹25L, so X+5 ≤ 25 => X ≤ 20. The only consistent solution requires X=20. Thus, R2(B,ST) = ₹20L, R6(A,ST) = ₹25L.
* Let R3(A,ST) = Y, R5(B,ST) = Z. Y+Z = 70 - 20 - 25 = 25.
* Let R4(B,LT) = G4. Then R1(A,LT) = G4+10.
* R3's Total = G4-5. R3(B,MT) = (G4-5) - Y.
* R5(A,MT) = R3(B,MT) = G4-5-Y.
* By solving the system of equations based on the total budget and ensuring all constraints (distinct total funding, R1's total being highest) are met, we find a unique solution: G4=50, Y=15, Z=10.
* This leads to the following funding amounts:
  R1(A,LT) = 60
  R2(A,MT) = 35, R2(B,ST) = 20
  R3(A,ST) = 15, R3(B,MT) = 30
  R4(B,LT) = 50
  R5(A,MT) = 30, R5(B,ST) = 10
  R6(A,ST) = 25

Final Annual Funding Table:
* R1: 60 Lakhs
* R2: 35 + 20 = 55 Lakhs
* R3: 15 + 30 = 45 Lakhs
* R4: 50 Lakhs
* R5: 30 + 10 = 40 Lakhs

Answer: From the derived grant details in the table, R2's total annual funding is ₹55 Lakhs."

1.  **R3's Total Annual Funding:** From the original solution, R3's total annual funding was derived to be ₹45 Lakhs. The question states this remains unchanged.
2.  **R3's Cycle A ST Grant:** From the original solution, R3's Cycle A ST grant was derived to be ₹15 Lakhs. The question states this also remains unchanged.
3.  **New Policy Check:** The new policy caps ST grants at ₹15 Lakhs. R3's original ST grant of ₹15 Lakhs already complies with this new cap, so its value is consistent and remains ₹15 Lakhs.
4.  **Calculation:** R3's total annual funding is the sum of its grant(s) for the year. R3 received one grant in Cycle A (ST) and one in Cycle B (MT).
R3's Total Funding = R3's Cycle A ST Funding + R3's Cycle B MT Funding

*   Bipul (BV_B) = 14
*   Esha (BV_E) = 13

Step 2: Use Regret logic to constrain Charan's and Divya's BVs.
*   Charan (BV_C) is the highest (Clue 3), so BV_C > 15. The maximum possible BV is 10+9=19.
*   Charan values Ankit's bundle at 18. If he regrets Ankit, 18 > BV_C. This implies BV_C can be 16, 17.
*   Divya (BV_D) values Bipul's bundle at 17. She regrets Bipul (Clue 4). This means 17 > BV_D.

Step 3: Determine Charan's BV.
*   The set of BVs is {13, 14, 15, BV_C, BV_D}. All must be distinct.
*   Case 1: Assume BV_C = 16. Then BV_D must be < 17 and not equal to 13, 14, 15, or 16. The only possible value for BV_D is not available. Wait, 17 > BV_D means BV_D can be anything up to 16. But if BV_C is 16, then BV_D must be something else, and also less than 17. So BV_D cannot be 16. Then, from the available numbers, BV_D must be less than 13, which is unlikely in such problems and would contradict other constraints if explored.
*   A better deduction for Divya: Divya regrets *only* Bipul. This means for Ankit, Charan, Esha, Divya's valuation of their bundle is <= her own BV_D. Bipul values Divya's bundle at 15. This implies Bipul regrets Divya, so 15 > Bipul's BV (14), which is true.
*   Let's re-evaluate Charan's BV. We have BV_C > 15. Possible values are {16, 17, 18, 19}. And we have 17 > BV_D.
    The known BVs are {13, 14, 15}. The remaining two are BV_C and BV_D.
    If BV_C = 16, then BV_D must be < 17 and not in {13, 14, 15, 16}. This leaves no integer slot for BV_D.
    If BV_C = 17, then BV_D must be < 17 and not in {13, 14, 15, 17}. The only integer slot left for BV_D is 16. This is a consistent solution.
*   Check if BV_C=17 works. Charan values Ankit's bundle at 18. Since 18 > 17 (his own BV), he regrets Ankit. This is consistent.

Step 5: Find the unique integer solution.
* We know CHC22 must be a multiple of 3. We also need (680 - 3*CHC22) to be divisible by 4. Since 680 is divisible by 4, 3*CHC22 must be divisible by 4. This means CHC22 must be a multiple of 4. Therefore, CHC22 must be a multiple of 12.
* Testing multiples of 12 for CHC22: If CHC22 = 120, then 4*CHB22 + 3*120 = 680 -> 4*CHB22 = 320 -> CHB22 = 80. This gives a clean integer solution that is consistent with all clues.
