A museum curator is evaluating the authenticity of five recently acquired artifacts (A1, A2, A3, A4, A5) using three distinct analytical tests (Test X, Test Y, Test Z). Each test can yield a result of ""Authentic"" (A), ""Inconclusive"" (I), or ""Fake"" (F) for each artifact. An artifact is declared ""Genuine"" only if it yields ""Authentic"" in at least two tests and ""Fake"" in no test.

Test Results and Conditions:
1.  Exactly *one* artifact was declared ""Genuine"".
2.  Artifact A3 yielded ""Authentic"" in Test X and Test Y.
3.  Test Z yielded ""Fake"" for artifact A2 and ""Authentic"" for artifact A4.
4.  No artifact yielded the same result in all three tests (e.g., A-A-A, F-F-F, I-I-I are not possible).
5.  If an artifact yielded ""Authentic"" in Test X, it did not yield ""Fake"" in Test Y.
6.  Artifact A1 yielded ""Inconclusive"" in more tests than any other artifact. (This means A1 has either two or three 'I' results. By rule 4, A1 cannot be (I,I,I), so A1 has exactly two 'I' results).
7.  Artifact A5 yielded ""Authentic"" in exactly one test.
8.  Among the artifacts not declared ""Genuine"" (i.e., A1, A2, A4, A5), exactly one had ""Fake"" as a result in Test Y.

Definition of Genuine: At least two 'A's and no 'F's.
2.  Artifact A3 yields 'A' in Test X and Test Y (Rule 2). For A3 to be Genuine, its Test Z result cannot be 'F'. By Rule 4 (no A-A-A), Test Z for A3 must be 'I'. So, A3 = (A, A, I). This artifact has two 'A's and no 'F's, so A3 is Genuine.
3.  Rule 1 states exactly one artifact is Genuine. Since A3 is Genuine, it is the only one.
4.  Artifact A2 has Test Z = F (Rule 3), so A2 is not Genuine.
5.  Artifact A4 has Test Z = A (Rule 3) but is not Genuine (Rule 10).
6.  Artifact A5 has exactly one 'A' (Rule 7). To be Genuine, an artifact needs at least two 'A's, so A5 is not Genuine.
7.  Artifact A1: Rule 6 states A1 has two 'I' results. If A1 were Genuine, it would need two 'A's and no 'F's (e.g., A,A,I), which means it would have only one 'I'. If A1 is (A,I,I) (to satisfy Rule 5 and Rule 6), it has only one 'A' and is therefore not Genuine.
Therefore, A3 is the only Genuine artifact."

    *   A3 = (A, A, I) - Genuine (from Q1 solution).
    *   A2: Test Z = F (Rule 3). A2 is not Genuine.

8.  A consistent matrix satisfying all rules:
    *   A1: (A, I, I) -> Not Genuine (1 'A'). Two 'I's.
    *   A2: (I, F, F) -> Not Genuine (contains 'F's). Test Z = F.

    *   A5: (I, A, F) -> Not Genuine (contains 'F'). One 'A' (Test Y = A).

    *   Rule 1: A3 is the sole Genuine artifact. (OK)
    *   Rule 2: A3 (Test X = A, Test Y = A). (OK). A3 Test Z = I (no A-A-A from Rule 4). (OK)

    *   Rule 5: (Test X = A implies Test Y != F): A1(Test X = A, Test Y = I) OK; A3(Test X = A, Test Y = A) OK.
    *   Rule 6: A1 has two 'I' results (derived as (A,I,I)). In the established consistent matrix, artifact A2 has one 'I' (I,F,F), A3 has one 'I' (A,A,I), A4 has one 'I' (F,I,A), and A5 has one 'I' (I,A,F). Thus, A1 with two 'I' results has 'Inconclusive' in more tests than any other artifact. (OK)

Original set of amounts: {P1=30, P2=15, P3=35, P4=20}.
We consider adding 5 units to one of these projects and check if Rules 1-5 hold for the new set of four amounts (where the other three amounts remain as original).

Case 1: If P1 receives the extra 5 units. New P1 = 35.
The amounts would be {35, 15, 35, 20}. This violates Rule 5 (P1 = P3).

Case 2: If P2 receives the extra 5 units. New P2 = 20.
The amounts would be {30, 20, 35, 20}. This violates Rule 5 (P2 = P4).

Case 3: If P3 receives the extra 5 units. New P3 = 40.

5.  Distinct: {30,15,40,20}. All distinct. (OK)
The sum is 30 + 15 + 40 + 20 = 105. This allocation is valid under the modified conditions.

Case 4: If P4 receives the extra 5 units. New P4 = 25.
The amounts would be {30, 15, 35, 25}.
Here D = 25, B = 15. Rule 4 (D = B + 5) becomes 25 = 15 + 5, which is 25 = 20. This is false. Thus, Rule 4 is violated.

1.  E1 Success = 63 (from Q18).

2.  E2 (Managers) attempts = 150 (30% of 500).
    Access rule for E2: PE = P AND VR = P.
    P(PE = P for E2) = 0.8, P(VR = P for E2) = 0.75. These are independent.
    P(Success for E2) = P(PE = P) * P(VR = P) = 0.8 * 0.75 = 0.6.
    Number of E2 successful attempts = 150 * 0.6 = 90.

3.  E3 (Analysts) attempts = 125 (25% of 500).
    Access rule for E3: BS = P AND VR = P.
    P(BS = P for E3) = 0.6.
    P(VR = P | BS = P for E3) = 0.8.
    P(Success for E3) = P(BS = P for E3) * P(VR = P | BS = P for E3) (since if BS = F, access is impossible because VR would also fail as per Rule 9: P(VR = P | BS = F for E3) = 0).
    P(Success for E3) = 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.48.
    Number of E3 successful attempts = 125 * 0.48 = 60.

4.  E4 (Interns) attempts = 125 (25% of 500).
    Access rule for E4: Pass any two of three layers.
    P(BS = P for E4) = 0.8. So, P(BS = F for E4) = 0.2.
    P(PE = P | BS = P for E4) = 1. So, if BS = P, then PE = P.
    P(PE = P | BS = F for E4) = 0.5. So, P(PE = F | BS = F for E4) = 0.5.
    P(VR = P for E4) = 0.5 (independent). So, P(VR = F for E4) = 0.5.

    Successful E4 combinations (at least two Passes):
    a) BS = P, PE = P, VR = P:
       Probability = P(BS = P) * P(PE = P | BS = P) * P(VR = P) = 0.8 * 1 * 0.5 = 0.4.
       Attempts = 125 * 0.4 = 50. (Access: BS,PE,VR all P)
    b) BS = P, PE = P, VR = F:
       Probability = P(BS = P) * P(PE = P | BS = P) * P(VR = F) = 0.8 * 1 * 0.5 = 0.4.
       Attempts = 125 * 0.4 = 50. (Access: BS,PE pass; VR fails -> 2 passes)
    c) BS = F, PE = P, VR = P:
       Probability = P(BS = F) * P(PE = P | BS = F) * P(VR = P) = 0.2 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.05.
       Attempts = 125 * 0.05 = 6.25. (Access: PE,VR pass; BS fails -> 2 passes)
    d) BS = P, PE = F, VR = P: This case is impossible because for E4, if BS = P, then PE = P (Rule 10).

    Total successful E4 attempts = 50 (for PPP) + 50 (for PPF) + 6.25 (for FPP) = 106.25.

Total successful attempts = E1 + E2 + E3 + E4
