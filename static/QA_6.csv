In triangle ABG, D is a point on AB such that AD = (1/3)AB. The line segment DG divides triangle ABG. Triangles ADG and ABG share the same altitude from vertex G to the base AB.
The ratio of their areas is equal to the ratio of their bases: Area(ADG) / Area(ABG) = AD / AB = 1/3.

So the expression becomes (4²⁰²³ + 6²⁰²³ + (-3)²⁰²³) mod 13.
By Fermat's Little Theorem, a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p) for a prime p. Here p=13. So a¹² ≡ 1 (mod 13).
We need to reduce the exponent 2023 modulo 12.
2023 = 12 × 168 + 7. So 2023 ≡ 7 (mod 12).
This means a²⁰²³ ≡ a⁷ (mod 13).
The expression is now (4⁷ + 6⁷ + (-3)⁷) mod 13.
Calculate each term:
4²=16≡3, 4³≡3*4=12≡-1. So 4⁷=(4³)²*4¹≡(-1)²*4 ≡ 4 (mod 13).
6²=36≡10≡-3, 6³≡6*(-3)=-18≡8, 6⁶≡8²=64≡12≡-1. So 6⁷=6⁶*6¹≡-1*6 ≡ -6 ≡ 7 (mod 13).
(-3)²=9, (-3)³=-27≡-1. So (-3)⁷=((-3)³)²*(-3)¹≡(-1)²*(-3) ≡ -3 ≡ 10 (mod 13).
Sum of remainders = 4 + 7 + 10 = 21.
21 mod 13 = 8.

Simran marks it up by 30% and then sells it to Tarun giving a discount of 10%. If Tarun paid Rs. 3510 for the article, what was the cost price of the article for Rahul?",MCQ,Q63,Quantitative Ability,40,MockSet1_QA,"Let Rahul's cost price (CP) be C.
Rahul sells to Simran at 20% profit. Simran's cost price = C * (1 + 20/100) = 1.2C.
Simran marks it up by 30%. Marked Price = 1.2C * (1 + 30/100) = 1.2C * 1.3 = 1.56C.
Simran sells to Tarun at a 10% discount. Tarun's price = Marked Price * (1 - 10/100) = 1.56C * 0.9 = 1.404C.
We are given that Tarun paid Rs. 3510.
So, 1.404C = 3510.
C = 3510 / 1.404 = 2500.
Rahul's cost price was Rs. 2500.

The diagonals PR and QS intersect at O. If PQ = 24 cm and RS = 36 cm, and the area of triangle POQ is 96 cm², find the area of trapezium PQRS in cm².",MCQ,Q64,Quantitative Ability,40,MockSet1_QA,"In trapezium PQRS with PQ || RS, triangles POQ and ROS are similar because corresponding angles are equal (alternate interior angles and vertically opposite angles).
The ratio of their corresponding sides is PQ/RS = 24/36 = 2/3.
The ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their sides: Area(POQ) / Area(ROS) = (2/3)² = 4/9.
Given Area(POQ) = 96 cm², we have 96 / Area(ROS) = 4/9.
Area(ROS) = 96 * 9 / 4 = 24 * 9 = 216 cm².
In a trapezium, the areas of the two triangles formed by the diagonals on the non-parallel sides are equal. So, Area(POS) = Area(QOR).
Also, triangles POQ and POS share a common height from vertex P to the base QS. So, Area(POS) / Area(POQ) = OS / OQ. From similarity, OS/OQ = RS/PQ = 3/2.
Area(POS) = Area(POQ) * (OS/OQ) = 96 * (3/2) = 144 cm².
So, Area(QOR) = 144 cm².
Total area of trapezium PQRS = Area(POQ) + Area(ROS) + Area(POS) + Area(QOR)
Area(PQRS) = 96 + 216 + 144 + 144 = 600 cm².

By Vieta's formulas:
Sum of roots: α + β = -(-7)/1 = 7.
Product of roots: αβ = 3/1 = 3.
We need to find the value of (α² + β²) and then substitute it into the given expression.
α² + β² = (α + β)² - 2αβ = (7)² - 2(3) = 49 - 6 = 43.
Now, let's evaluate the expression: ((α²+β²)²)/(α² + β² - αβ).
Numerator = (α² + β²)² = (43)² = 1849.
Denominator = (α² + β²) - αβ = 43 - 3 = 40.

Find the value of f(10).",TITA,Q66,Quantitative Ability,40,MockSet1_QA,"The recurrence relation is f(n) - f(n-1) = f(n-1) - f(n-2) + 3.
Let g(n) = f(n) - f(n-1). Then g(n) = g(n-1) + 3.
This shows that g(n) is an arithmetic progression with common difference 3.
g(2) = f(2) - f(1) = 5 - 2 = 3.
So, g(n) is an AP: 3, 6, 9, ... with g(n) = 3(n-1) for n ≥ 2.
So, f(n) - f(n-1) = 3(n-1).
We can write f(n) as a sum:
f(n) = f(1) + [f(2)-f(1)] + [f(3)-f(2)] + ... + [f(n)-f(n-1)]
f(n) = f(1) + Σ (f(k) - f(k-1)) for k=2 to n
f(n) = f(1) + Σ g(k) for k=2 to n
f(n) = 2 + Σ 3(k-1) for k=2 to n
Let j = k-1. The sum becomes Σ 3j for j=1 to n-1.
f(n) = 2 + 3 * Σ j for j=1 to n-1
f(n) = 2 + 3 * [(n-1)n / 2].
We need to find f(10).
f(10) = 2 + 3 * [(10-1)(10) / 2] = 2 + 3 * [9 * 5] = 2 + 3 * 45 = 2 + 135 = 137.
