"Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation","","Q25","1","Set1_Artifacts","An archaeological team has unearthed five Artifacts (A1, A2, A3, A4, A5) from a newly discovered site. Each artifact belongs to one of three historical Periods: Early (E), Middle (M), or Late (L). The team uses a Carbon Dating process which yields a ""Plausibility Score"" (PS, an integer from 1 to 10) for each artifact being from each period. An artifact is assigned to the period for which it has the highest unique PS. If an artifact has the same highest PS for multiple periods, its period is ""Undetermined"" initially.

Derivation:
• First, find Delta's scores. We know T_A=3, T_B=4 (from Q11), T_G=1. The sum of T scores is 10. So, T_D = 10 - 3 - 4 - 1 = 2.
• For Delta, I_D = T_D, so I_D=2. We are given C_D=3.
• Using the weights wI=0.3, wT=0.5, wC=0.2:
• OPS_D = wI*I_D + wT*T_D + wC*C_D = 0.3(2) + 0.5(2) + 0.2(3) = 0.6 + 1.0 + 0.6 = 2.2."

Derivation:
1. Solve for 'exactly two' enrollments: N_AB + N_AS + N_BS = 90. Given N_AB = N_AS+5 and N_BS = N_AB-10 = (N_AS+5)-10 = N_AS-5. Substitute into the sum: (N_AS+5) + N_AS + (N_AS-5) = 90 => 3*N_AS = 90 => N_AS=30. From this, N_AB=35 and N_BS=25.
2. Set up the total enrollment equation: Total = (Only AA + Only BE + Only SL) + (Exactly Two) + (All Three) = 250. This becomes: 3*X + 90 + N_ABC = 250.
3. Use the relation N_ABC = 0.2*X. Substitute into the equation: 3X + 90 + 0.2X = 250 => 3.2X = 160 => X = 50.
