Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation,40,MOCKCAT24S2GEN_Q1,1,MOCKCAT24S2GEN_Set1_ProjectTimeline,"Three software projects – Alpha, Beta, and Gamma – are being executed by a company. Each project goes through four distinct phases: Design, Development, Testing, and Deployment, in that specific order for any given project. Three specialized teams – Team A, Team B, and Team C – are responsible for carrying out these phases. The duration of each phase for each project is an integer number of days. The timeline for these projects spans from Day 1 to Day 30. A team can only work on one specific phase of one specific project at any given time. Once a team starts a phase for a project, they work on it continuously until that phase is completed for that project.

We need to fill a 3 (Semester) x 4 (Department) grid with 12 courses, each with a Level and Credits.
Clue 1: Fall=100L, Spring=200L, Summer=300L.
Clue 5: Total courses = 12, so there are six 3-credit and six 4-credit courses.

**1. Department Credit Structures:**
- **Econ (Clue 4):** Two 3cr, one 4cr. C8 is 4cr, so C8 is the Spring course: **C8 (Econ, Spring, 200L, 4cr)**. C12 is Summer (Clue 6), so it must be 3cr: **C12 (Econ, Summer, 300L, 3cr)**. The Fall course is also 3cr.
- **Physics (Clue 3):** Two 4cr, one 3cr. C3 is 4cr. Given Fall courses are introductory, C3 is likely the Fall course: **C3 (Phy, Fall, 100L, 4cr)**. The other Phy courses (Spring, Summer) are one 4cr and one 3cr.
- **Maths (Clue 7):** Total credits = 10. C6 is a Spring 3cr course (Clue 6): **C6 (Maths, Spring, 200L, 3cr)**. The Fall and Summer Maths courses must total 7 credits, meaning one is 3cr and the other is 4cr.
- **CS:** C1 is a 3cr CS course (Clue 2), so **C1 (CS, Fall, 100L, 3cr)**. Total 3cr courses are now: C1(CS), C6(Maths), Econ_Fall, C12(Econ), one from Phy, one from Maths = 6. This is all. So, all other courses are 4cr. Total 4cr courses are: C8(Econ), C3(Phy), one from Phy, one from Maths, and the remaining two from CS. Thus, CS has one 3cr course (C1) and two 4cr courses.

**2. Final Course Assignment:**
- **CS:** C1(Fall,3cr). C9 is a CS course (Clue 7). C5 is 4cr (Clue 6). The two 4cr CS courses must be C5 and C9. Assigning them to Spring/Summer: **C5(CS, Spring, 200L, 4cr)**, **C9(CS, Summer, 300L, 4cr)**.
- Unassigned IDs: {C2, C4, C7, C10, C11}. Slots: Econ(F,3cr), Maths(F,4cr), Maths(Su,3cr), Phy(Sp,3cr), Phy(Su,4cr). (This specific credit assignment for Maths and Phy is one possible combination that satisfies all constraints and question answers).
- **Econ Fall (3cr):** Takes an unassigned ID, e.g., **C4 (Econ, Fall, 100L, 3cr)**.
- **Maths:** C10 is a Maths course. The other must be C2. **C2(Maths, Fall, 100L, 4cr)**, **C10(Maths, Summer, 300L, 3cr)**.
- **Physics:** Remaining IDs are C7, C11. **C7(Phy, Spring, 200L, 3cr)**, **C11(Phy, Summer, 300L, 4cr)**.

We need to fill a 3 (Semester) x 4 (Department) grid with 12 courses, each with a Level and Credits.
Clue 1: Fall=100L, Spring=200L, Summer=300L.
Clue 5: Total courses = 12, so there are six 3-credit and six 4-credit courses.

**1. Department Credit Structures:**
- **Econ (Clue 4):** Two 3cr, one 4cr. C8 is 4cr, so C8 is the Spring course: **C8 (Econ, Spring, 200L, 4cr)**. C12 is Summer (Clue 6), so it must be 3cr: **C12 (Econ, Summer, 300L, 3cr)**. The Fall course is also 3cr.
- **Physics (Clue 3):** Two 4cr, one 3cr. C3 is 4cr. Given Fall courses are introductory, C3 is likely the Fall course: **C3 (Phy, Fall, 100L, 4cr)**. The other Phy courses (Spring, Summer) are one 4cr and one 3cr.
- **Maths (Clue 7):** Total credits = 10. C6 is a Spring 3cr course (Clue 6): **C6 (Maths, Spring, 200L, 3cr)**. The Fall and Summer Maths courses must total 7 credits, meaning one is 3cr and the other is 4cr.
- **CS:** C1 is a 3cr CS course (Clue 2), so **C1 (CS, Fall, 100L, 3cr)**. Total 3cr courses are now: C1(CS), C6(Maths), Econ_Fall, C12(Econ), one from Phy, one from Maths = 6. This is all. So, all other courses are 4cr. Total 4cr courses are: C8(Econ), C3(Phy), one from Phy, one from Maths, and the remaining two from CS. Thus, CS has one 3cr course (C1) and two 4cr courses.

**2. Final Course Assignment:**
- **CS:** C1(Fall,3cr). C9 is a CS course (Clue 7). C5 is 4cr (Clue 6). The two 4cr CS courses must be C5 and C9. Assigning them to Spring/Summer: **C5(CS, Spring, 200L, 4cr)**, **C9(CS, Summer, 300L, 4cr)**.
- Unassigned IDs: {C2, C4, C7, C10, C11}. Slots: Econ(F,3cr), Maths(F,4cr), Maths(Su,3cr), Phy(Sp,3cr), Phy(Su,4cr). (This specific credit assignment for Maths and Phy is one possible combination that satisfies all constraints and question answers).
- **Econ Fall (3cr):** Takes an unassigned ID, e.g., **C4 (Econ, Fall, 100L, 3cr)**.
- **Maths:** C10 is a Maths course. The other must be C2. **C2(Maths, Fall, 100L, 4cr)**, **C10(Maths, Summer, 300L, 3cr)**.
- **Physics:** Remaining IDs are C7, C11. **C7(Phy, Spring, 200L, 3cr)**, **C11(Phy, Summer, 300L, 4cr)**.

| Econ  | C4 (3cr)        | C8 (4cr)        | C12 (3cr)        |

**Answer Explanation:**
1.  Clue 4 states the Economics department offers two 3-credit courses and one 4-credit course. C8 is the 4-credit Economics course.
2.  Clue 6 states C12 is offered in the Summer semester by the Economics department.
3.  Since C8 is the only 4-credit Economics course, C12 must be one of the two 3-credit courses.
4.  Therefore, C12 carries 3 credits."

This is a complex distribution problem. We can solve it by building tables for each cargo type (P, F, S, H) showing shipments from Warehouse (W1, W2, W3) to City (C1, C2, C3, C4).

**1. Totals and Initial Deductions:**
- **Cargo Totals:** P=100, F=150, S=200, H=50. Grand Total = 500.
- **W1 (Total 180):** P=40, F=70. W1C3_H=20. W1_S = 180-40-70-20=50. Ships to C1,C2,C3 only.
- **W3 (Total 120):** P=30, F=20. W3C1_Total=50 (not P or F). Ships to C1,C2,C3 only.
- **W2 (Total 200):** W2C4_F=10, S=100, P=30. By deduction, W2_F=60, W2_H=10.
- **C1 (Total 190):** P=30, H=30.
- **C2 (Total 150):** H=0, P=45, F=65. So, C2_S=150-45-65=40.
- **C3:** H=20 (all from W1), P=25, W2C3_P=0.
- **C4:** Only receives from W2. Total P=100-(30+45+25)=0. Total H=50-(30+0+20)=0. So C4 receives only F and S from W2. W2C4_F=10.

**2. Detailed Distribution (H, P, F, S):**
- **Hazardous (H):** W1_H=20 (all to C3). C1_H=30, must be from W2+W3. W2_H=10, W3_H=20. So W2C1_H=10, W3C1_H=20.
- **W3 to C1:** Total=50. W3C1_P=0, W3C1_F=0. We found W3C1_H=20. So, W3C1_S=50-20=30.
- **Perishable (P):** A system of linear equations based on row/column totals. A unique solution is found: W1(C1:20, C2:15, C3:5), W2(C1:10, C2:20), W3(C2:10, C3:20).
- **Fragile (F):** Another system of equations. A unique solution is found: W1(C1:30, C2:25, C3:15), W2(C1:20, C2:30, C4:10), W3(C2:10, C3:10).
- **Standard (S):** The remaining values can be deduced. W1C2_S can be found by looking at W1 totals. W1_S=50. W1C1_S is needed. W1 to C1: P(20)+F(30)+S(?)+H(0). W1 to C2: P(15)+F(25)+S(?)+H(0). W1 to C3: P(5)+F(15)+S(?)+H(20). If we assume consistent total shipments from W1 to cities (e.g., 70,70,40), we get W1C1_S=20, W1C2_S=30, W1C3_S=0. This satisfies W1_S_Total=50.

**Final Derived Table (Standard Cargo only):**
| S   | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | W_Total |
|:----|:---|:---|:---|:---|:--------|
| W1  | 20 | 30 | 0  | 0  | 50      |

- **C1 (Total 190):** P=30, H=30.
- **C2 (Total 150):** H=0, P=45, F=65. So, C2_S=150-45-65=40.
- **C3:** H=20 (all from W1), P=25, W2C3_P=0.
- **C4:** Only receives from W2. Total P=100-(30+45+25)=0. Total H=50-(30+0+20)=0. So C4 receives only F and S from W2. W2C4_F=10.

**2. Detailed Distribution (H, P, F, S):**
- **Hazardous (H):** W1_H=20 (all to C3). C1_H=30, must be from W2+W3. W2_H=10, W3_H=20. So W2C1_H=10, W3C1_H=20.
- **Perishable (P):** A system of linear equations based on row/column totals. A unique solution is found: W1(C1:20, C2:15, C3:5), W2(C1:10, C2:20), W3(C2:10, C3:20).
- **Fragile (F):** Another system of equations. A unique solution is found: W1(C1:30, C2:25, C3:15), W2(C1:20, C2:30, C4:10), W3(C2:10, C3:10).

**Answer Explanation:**
1.  The question asks for the total number of Fragile (F) cargo units received by City C3.
2.  We need to sum the Fragile cargo shipments to C3 from all warehouses: W1C3_F + W2C3_F + W3C3_F.
3.  From our derived table for Fragile cargo, these values are 15 (from W1), 0 (from W2), and 10 (from W3).
4.  Total Fragile cargo to C3 = 15 + 0 + 10 = 25 units."

This is a complex distribution problem. We can solve it by building tables for each cargo type (P, F, S, H) showing shipments from Warehouse (W1, W2, W3) to City (C1, C2, C3, C4).

**1. Totals and Initial Deductions:**
- **Cargo Totals:** P=100, F=150, S=200, H=50. Grand Total = 500.
- **W1 (Total 180):** P=40, F=70. W1C3_H=20. W1_S = 180-40-70-20=50. Ships to C1,C2,C3 only.
- **W3 (Total 120):** P=30, F=20. W3C1_Total=50 (not P or F). Ships to C1,C2,C3 only.
- **W2 (Total 200):** W2C4_F=10, S=100, P=30. By deduction, W2_F=60, W2_H=10.
- **C1 (Total 190):** P=30, H=30.
- **C2 (Total 150):** H=0, P=45, F=65. So, C2_S=150-45-65=40.
- **C3:** H=20 (all from W1), P=25, W2C3_P=0.
- **C4:** Only receives from W2. Total P=100-(30+45+25)=0. Total H=50-(30+0+20)=0. So C4 receives only F and S from W2. W2C4_F=10.

**2. Detailed Distribution (H, P, F, S):**
- **Hazardous (H):** W1_H=20 (all to C3). C1_H=30, must be from W2+W3. W2_H=10, W3_H=20. So W2C1_H=10, W3C1_H=20.
- **W3 to C1:** Total=50. W3C1_P=0, W3C1_F=0. We found W3C1_H=20. So, W3C1_S=50-20=30.
- **Standard (S):** After solving for P and F, we can fully determine S. The city totals for S are C1=80, C2=40, C3=60, C4=20.

**Final Derived Table (Standard Cargo only):**
| S   | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | W_Total |
|:----|:---|:---|:---|:---|:--------|
| W1  | 20 | 30 | 0  | 0  | 50      |
| W2  | 30 | 10 | 40 | 20 | 100     |
| W3  | 30 | 0  | 20 | 0  | 50      |
|C_Tot| 80 | 40 | 60 | 20 | 200     |

**Answer Explanation:**
1.  We need to compare the total Standard (S) cargo received by each city.
2.  From the 'C_Tot' (City Totals) row of our derived table for Standard cargo:
    *   City C1 received 80 units.
    *   City C2 received 40 units.
    *   City C3 received 60 units.
    *   City C4 received 20 units.
3.  Comparing these values, City C1 received the highest amount of Standard cargo."

This is a complex distribution problem. We can solve it by building tables for each cargo type (P, F, S, H) showing shipments from Warehouse (W1, W2, W3) to City (C1, C2, C3, C4).

**1. Warehouse and Cargo Totals:**
- Cargo Totals: H=50.
- W1: Total H = 20 (all to C3).
- W2: Total P=30, S=100, F(deduced)=60. W2_Total=200, so W2_H = 200-30-100-60 = 10.
- W3: Total P=30, F=20, S(deduced)=50. W3_Total=120, so W3_H = 120-30-20-50 = 20.

**2. City Hazardous Cargo Receipts:**
- C1: Total H = 30.
- C2: Total H = 0.
- C3: Total H = 20 (all from W1).
- C4: Total H = 50(Total) - 30(C1) - 0(C2) - 20(C3) = 0.

**3. Detailed Hazardous (H) Distribution:**
| H   | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | W_Total |

| W1  | 0  | 0  | 20 | 0  | 20      |
| W2  | ?  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 10      |
| W3  | ?  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 20      |
|C_Tot| 30 | 0  | 20 | 0  | 50      |

**Answer Explanation:**
1. The question asks for Hazardous (H) cargo from W3 to C1 (W3C1_H).
2. From the table above, the entire Hazardous cargo supply for W2 (10 units) must go to a city other than C2, C3, C4. The only option is C1. So, W2C1_H = 10.
3. City C1 needs a total of 30 units of H. It gets 0 from W1 and 10 from W2.
4. Therefore, the remaining H for C1 must come from W3. W3C1_H = 30 - 0 - 10 = 20.
5. This is consistent with W3's total H shipment of 20 units."

We create a 5x5 grid (Employee vs. Day) and fill it using the clues, ensuring row (Employee Total) and column (Day Total) sums are met.

**1. Initial Grid and Knowns:**
- Row Totals: E1=8, E2=7, E3=9, E4=6, E5=8.
- Column Totals: Mon=8, Tue=7, Wed=8, Thu=8, Fri=7.
- Clue 3: E1_W=3, E2_W=0, E5_W=2.
- Clue 4: E3_M=3, E4_M=0.
- Clue 6: E2_Tu=3, E5_Tu=1, E5_F=1.
- Clue 7: E1_M=2, E3_F=3.

**2. Deductions for E4:**
- E4_Total=6. E4_M=0, E4_F=0 (Clue 5).
- E4_Tu=E4_W+1, E4_Th=E4_W+2 (Clue 5).
- E4_Total = 0 + (E4_W+1) + E4_W + (E4_W+2) + 0 = 6 => 3*E4_W + 3 = 6 => **E4_W=1**.
- From this, **E4_Tu=2** and **E4_Th=3**.

**3. Filling the Grid Step-by-Step:**
- **Wednesday:** Total=8. E1(3)+E2(0)+E3_W+E4(1)+E5(2) = 8 => **E3_W=2**.
- **Tuesday:** Total=7. E1_Tu+E2(3)+E3_Tu+E4(2)+E5(1) = 7 => E1_Tu+E3_Tu = 1.
- **Employee E3:** Total=9. E3_M(3)+E3_Tu+E3_W(2)+E3_Th+E3_F(3) = 9 => E3_Tu+E3_Th = 1.
- Since E1_Tu+E3_Tu=1 and E3_Tu+E3_Th=1, and all values are non-negative integers, the only possibilities are (E1_Tu, E3_Tu, E3_Th) = (1,0,1) or (0,1,0).
- Let's test Case 1: **E3_Tu=0**. This implies **E1_Tu=1** and **E3_Th=1**. This path leads to a consistent solution.

**4. Finalizing the Grid:**
- We now have many values. We can solve the rest using row/column sums.
- E1 Total=8: E1_M(2)+E1_Tu(1)+E1_W(3)+E1_Th+E1_F = 8 => E1_Th+E1_F=2.
- Fri Total=7: E1_F+E2_F+E3(3)+E4(0)+E5(1) = 7 => E1_F+E2_F=3.
- This creates a small system. If we assume E1_F=2, then E1_Th=0 and E2_F=1. This assumption works out perfectly when completing the rest of the grid for E2 and E5.

**Final Grid:**

| E5       | 2   | 1   | 2   | 2   | 1   | 8         |

**Answer Explanation:**
1.  The question asks for the number of shifts Employee E3 worked on Tuesday (E3_Tu).
2.  During the derivation process, we established two constraints: E1_Tu + E3_Tu = 1 (from Tuesday's total) and E3_Tu + E3_Th = 1 (from E3's total).
3.  The only consistent solution for the entire grid arises when E3_Tu = 0.

We create a 5x5 grid (Employee vs. Day) and fill it using the clues, ensuring row (Employee Total) and column (Day Total) sums are met.

**1. Initial Grid and Knowns:**
- Row Totals: E1=8, E2=7, E3=9, E4=6, E5=8.
- Column Totals: Mon=8, Tue=7, Wed=8, Thu=8, Fri=7.
- Clue 3: E1_W=3, E2_W=0, E5_W=2.
- Clue 4: E3_M=3, E4_M=0.
- Clue 6: E2_Tu=3, E5_Tu=1, E5_F=1.
- Clue 7: E1_M=2, E3_F=3.

**2. Deductions for E4:**
- E4_Total=6. E4_M=0, E4_F=0 (Clue 5).
- E4_Tu=E4_W+1, E4_Th=E4_W+2 (Clue 5).
- E4_Total = 0 + (E4_W+1) + E4_W + (E4_W+2) + 0 = 6 => 3*E4_W + 3 = 6 => **E4_W=1**.
- From this, **E4_Tu=2** and **E4_Th=3**.

**3. Filling the Grid Step-by-Step:**
- After filling in all direct clues and the deductions for E4, we use row and column sums to find the remaining values. This leads to a unique solution.

**Final Grid:**

- Total S = 63, At least two events = 45.

**Answer Explanation:**
This is a hypothetical question where we must check for consistency.
1.  **New Premise:** S_o_new = 35.
2.  **Explicitly Stated Intersections and Derived Values to Remain Constant:**
    - SC_nD = 15, SD_nC = 10, CD_nS = 12 (from clues 3, 4, 5)

    - Total S = 63 (from clue 6)
    - At least two events = 45 (from clue 7)
4.  **Check for Consistency:** Let's test the 'Total S = 63' rule with the new premise.
    - Total S = S_o_new + SC_nD + SD_nC + SCD
    - Total S = 35 + 15 + 10 + 8 = 68.
5.  This result (68) contradicts the rule that Total S must be 63. The premises of the hypothetical scenario are internally inconsistent.
6.  Because the given conditions lead to a contradiction, it's impossible to determine a value for 'Cultural Fest only' under these new rules.
7.  Therefore, the answer cannot be determined due to these inconsistencies."
