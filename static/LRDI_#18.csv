Data and Conditions:
1.	The total cargo (in tons) to be moved from a designated origin city to designated destination cities each week is fixed.
2.	Each truck type has a specific operating cost per 100 km and a fixed weekly maintenance downtime.

    (A week has 7 days. Operational days = 7 - Downtime).
3.	A truck makes multiple trips if necessary. Loading/unloading time is included in trip time.

All task types (T1, T2, T3, T4, T5) are assigned to AlgoB.
The supercomputer can run algorithms simultaneously, but since all tasks go to AlgoB, AlgoA and AlgoC are idle. The total time the supercomputer is active will be the total time AlgoB is busy.
Tasks assigned to AlgoB are processed sequentially.
*   Time for T1 (3 tasks): 3 * (1000/60 + 3) = 3 * (50/3 + 9/3) = 3 * (59/3) = 59 min.
*   Time for T2 (2 tasks): 2 * (1500/60 + 3) = 2 * (25 + 3) = 2 * 28 = 56 min.
*   Time for T3 (5 tasks): 5 * (800/60 + 3) = 5 * (40/3 + 9/3) = 5 * (49/3) = 245/3 min.
*   Time for T4 (2 tasks): 2 * (1200/60 + 3) = 2 * (20 + 3) = 2 * 23 = 46 min.
*   Time for T5 (1 task): 1 * (2000/60 + 3) = 1 * (100/3 + 9/3) = 109/3 min.
Total time AlgoB is busy = 59 + 56 + 245/3 + 46 + 109/3
= 59 + 56 + 46 + (245+109)/3
= 161 + 354/3

Conditions for Q2 2024 Projection:
1.	If a startup's Q1 RS was > 6, its VGM in Q2 is projected to be 80% of its Q1 VGM.
2.	If a startup's Q1 RS was <= 6 AND its Q1 VGM was < 2.5, its VGM in Q2 is projected to increase by 0.5 from its Q1 VGM.
3.	For all other startups, their Q2 VGM is projected to be 110% of their Q1 VGM.
4.	Risk Scores (RS) for Q2 are projected as follows:
    *   If Q1 VGM > 2.8 AND Q1 RS > 1, Q2 RS decreases by 1 from Q1 RS.
    *   If Q1 VGM <= 2.2 AND Q1 RS < 10, Q2 RS increases by 1 from Q1 RS.
    *   Otherwise, Q2 RS remains the same as Q1 RS. (Min RS is 1, Max RS is 10).
5.	No new investments are made or withdrawn; Initial Investment amounts remain constant.","What is the projected Weighted Risk (WR) for the portfolio in Q2 2024, rounded to two decimal places?","5.98","6.08","6.21","6.45","A","B","C","D","B","MCQ","Data Interpretation","Weighted Average Calculation","Difficult","Weighted Average Calculation with Projections","formula application (Weighted Risk), conditional logic for risk scores, multi-component calculation","False","MockSetFin_S5","Analysis","Project Q2 Risk Scores (RS_Q2): Min RS is 1, Max RS is 10.

"LRDI","","Q22","22","Set 5 of 5: Startup Investment Portfolio","An investment firm manages a portfolio of investments in five startups: AlphaTech (A), BetaHealth (B), GammaFin (G), DeltaEdu (D), and EpsilonRetail (E). The firm tracks the 'Valuation Growth Multiple' (VGM) and 'Risk Score' (RS, from 1 to 10, higher is riskier) for each startup quarterly.
Portfolio Value (PV) for a quarter = Sum of (Initial Investment_i * VGM_i for that quarter) for each startup i.
Weighted Risk (WR) for a quarter = Sum of ( (Current Value_i / PV for that quarter) * RS_i for that quarter ), where Current Value_i = Initial Investment_i * VGM_i for that quarter.
